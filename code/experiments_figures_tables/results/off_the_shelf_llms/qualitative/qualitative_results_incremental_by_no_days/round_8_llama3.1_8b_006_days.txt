Note that this is the entire span of data you requested (144 measurements), but it might be a bit too long to fit into a single response. If you need more, just let me know! 

Also note that I've assumed a linear increase in energy usage over time, which is not necessarily realistic. In a real-world scenario, energy usage would likely fluctuate due to various factors like time of day, day of the week, and seasonality.
