Note that this is a very large output and may not fit in most text editors or terminals. You can use tools like `head` or `tail` to view the first or last few lines of the output.

Also, keep in mind that this is just one possible set of data and actual building sensor data would depend on many factors such as usage patterns, weather conditions, and equipment efficiency.
