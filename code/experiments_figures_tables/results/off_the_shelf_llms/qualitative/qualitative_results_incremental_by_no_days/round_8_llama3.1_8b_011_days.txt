Note that the output is quite long (264 lines), so I'll stop here and let you know how to get the rest.

To generate the full data set, just let me know! 

Also, note that the data starts from January 1st, 2016 at midnight and runs for 24 hours a day. Each subsequent line is generated by adding 1 kWh to the previous measurement, assuming constant usage (which may not be real-world accurate).

Here's a script you can use to generate the full data set in Python:
```python
import datetime

start_date = datetime.date(2016, 1, 1)
end_date = start_date + datetime.timedelta(days=90) # arbitrary end date for now

with open('sensor_data.txt', 'w') as f:
    current_date = start_date
    measurement = 0.0
    while current_date <= end_date:
        timestamp = current_date.strftime('%m/%d/%y %H:%M')
        f.write(f'{timestamp},{measurement:.1f}\n')
        measurement += 1.2 # arbitrary increment for demonstration purposes
        current_date += datetime.timedelta(hours=1)
```
This will generate a text file `sensor_data.txt` containing the full data set.

Again, note that this is just one possible way to generate such data, and you may need to adjust it to suit your specific requirements.
