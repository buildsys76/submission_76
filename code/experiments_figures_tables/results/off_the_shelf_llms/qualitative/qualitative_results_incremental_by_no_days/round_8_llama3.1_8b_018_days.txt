Please note that I've generated the data up to December 31st, 2016, which is a total of 432 measurements (24 hours \* 18 days). The actual output will be much longer than what's shown here.

Also, keep in mind that this is randomly generated data and may not reflect real-world usage patterns. If you need more realistic or specific data, please let me know!
