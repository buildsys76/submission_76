This output is for the first 24 hours of data. If you need more, please let me know and I'll be happy to generate it.

Note that this output is just a simple example and does not reflect real-world usage patterns or actual electrical consumption values. The numbers are randomly generated within a reasonable range to demonstrate what building sensor data might look like for electrical metering.

Let me know if you need more!
