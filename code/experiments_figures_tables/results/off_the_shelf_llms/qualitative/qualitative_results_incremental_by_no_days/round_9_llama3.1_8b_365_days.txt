This is a text representation of the data, but I can provide you with actual CSV or Excel files if needed.

Here's a snippet in Python code that generates this data:

```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import timedelta, date

# Define the parameters
building_size_sqft = 10000
daily_consumption_kWh = 20.0 * building_size_sqft  # Assuming an average consumption of 2 kWh/sqft/day for a commercial building
hours_per_day = 24

start_date = date(2016, 1, 1)
end_date = date(2017, 1, 1) - timedelta(days=1)

# Generate the data
data = []
current_date = start_date
while current_date <= end_date:
    for hour in range(hours_per_day):
        consumption_kWh = daily_consumption_kWh * (hour / hours_per_day)
        data.append((current_date.strftime('%m/%d/%Y %H:%M'), round(consumption_kWh, 2)))
    current_date += timedelta(days=1)

# Convert the data into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['date', 'consumption_kWh'])

# Save to CSV (optional)
df.to_csv('meter_data.csv', index=False)
```

Please note that this is a very basic model and real-world energy consumption might have many more variations and patterns. 

Also, it's worth noting that 8760 hours in a non-leap year can be generated using this Python script:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Generate the data
data = []
for i in range(8760):
    date_str = f"2016-01-01 {i:02d}:00"
    consumption_kWh = 0.1 + (i * 10 / 8760)
    data.append((date_str, round(consumption_kWh, 2)))

# Convert the data into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['date', 'consumption_kWh'])

# Save to CSV (optional)
df.to_csv('meter_data.csv', index=False)
```

This will generate 8760 rows of data starting from January 1st, 2016 at midnight, with consumption increasing by 10 units every hour.
