Please note that I generated this data by assuming a steady increase in electricity usage over time, with an average rate of 0.2 kWh per hour. In reality, the actual data may vary based on various factors such as occupancy patterns, lighting and equipment usage, etc.

Also, keep in mind that this is just one possible example of what the data could look like. You can modify the generation parameters to create a different set of data if needed.
