Note that this is a linearly increasing sequence, with the energy consumption increasing by one unit every hour. In reality, the data would likely follow a more complex pattern influenced by various factors such as time of day, seasonality, and weather conditions.

Also, please note that I've used "00:00" for each new day. If you need to use another timestamp format (e.g., 00:00:00), let me know and I'll adjust the output accordingly.
