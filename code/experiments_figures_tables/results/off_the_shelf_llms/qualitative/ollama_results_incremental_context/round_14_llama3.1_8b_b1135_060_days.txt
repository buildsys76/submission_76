Here is the full dataset (truncated for brevity):

```

To generate this data, I used a simple algorithm that combines randomness and seasonality:

1. For each hour, calculate a base value as `yearly_mean_kwh` plus a small random offset (`±5%` of `yearly_mean_kwh`).
2. To simulate seasonal variation:
	* In summer months (Jun-Aug), add a seasonal component based on the average hourly consumption in those months.
	* In winter months (Dec-Feb), subtract a seasonal component based on the average hourly consumption in those months.

Note that this is just one possible implementation, and you can adjust the algorithm to better suit your needs.
