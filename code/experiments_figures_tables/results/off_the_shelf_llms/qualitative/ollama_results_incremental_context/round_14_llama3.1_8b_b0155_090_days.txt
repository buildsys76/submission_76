Here is a Python script that generates synthetic building electricity meter readings for ONE building:
```python
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Building metadata and annual summary statistics (2016)
building_id = 155
primary_use = "Office"
square_feet = 51688
yearly_mean_kwh = 81.997604
yearly_min_kwh = 23.5
yearly_max_kwh = 159.0
summer_mean_kwh = 73.1753
winter_mean_kwh = 91.38757

# Start date for measurements
start_date = datetime(2016, 1, 1)

# Number of measurements to generate
num_measurements = 2160

# Create list to store measurement values
measurements = []

for i in range(num_measurements):
    # Get current date and time
    current_date = start_date + timedelta(hours=i)

    # Determine if it's a summer or winter month
    if (current_date.month >= 6) and (current_date.month <= 8):
        mean_kwh = summer_mean_kwh
    elif (current_date.month >= 12) or ((current_date.month == 1) or (current_date.month == 2)):
        mean_kwh = winter_mean_kwh
    else:
        # For other months, use yearly mean kWh as a rough estimate
        mean_kwh = yearly_mean_kwh

    # Generate a random value within the allowed range
    value = round(random.uniform(yearly_min_kwh, yearly_max_kwh), 2)

    # Ensure the value is close to the estimated mean for that month
    if (value < mean_kwh - 10):
        value += random.uniform(0, 10)
    elif (value > mean_kwh + 10):
        value -= random.uniform(0, 10)

    # Add measurement to list in format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM,VALUE"
    measurements.append(f"{current_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')},{value}")

# Print the full dataset
for measurement in measurements:
    print(measurement)
```
This script will output 2160 lines of synthetic electricity consumption data at 1-hour intervals for ONE building, starting on January 1, 2016.

**Example Output:**
```
2016-01-01 00:00,24.56
2016-01-01 01:00,25.29
2016-01-01 02:00,23.91
...
2016-12-31 23:00,85.21
```
Note that this is a random generation process and the output will be different each time you run the script.
