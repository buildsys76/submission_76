To generate synthetic building electricity meter readings, we can use a Python script that simulates hourly energy consumption based on the provided metadata and summary statistics. Here's an implementation using NumPy for efficient numerical operations:

```python
import numpy as np
from datetime import timedelta, datetime

# Building metadata and annual summary statistics (2016)
building_id = 272
primary_use = "Education"
square_feet = 4583
yearly_mean_kwh = 17.38018
yearly_min_kwh = 0.8
yearly_max_kwh = 74.32
summer_mean_kwh = 25.539513
winter_mean_kwh = 11.742976

# Number of measurements (1-hour intervals)
n_measurements = 1440

# Generate timestamp for start and end dates
start_date = datetime(2016, 1, 1)
end_date = start_date + timedelta(days=365)

dates = [start_date + timedelta(hours=i) for i in range(n_measurements)]

# Calculate summer and winter months as arrays of boolean values
summer_months = np.array([d.month >= 6 and d.month <= 8 for d in dates])
winter_months = np.array([d.month >= 12 or (d.month < 6 and d.month != 3) for d in dates])

# Set parameters to control variability around mean consumption
# These can be adjusted based on real data analysis for better accuracy
summer_std_dev = yearly_max_kwh / 4.0  # Variability during summer months
winter_std_dev = yearly_mean_kwh / 2.5  # Lower variability during winter months

# Generate consumption values with varying standard deviations depending on the time of year
consumption_values = np.zeros(n_measurements)
for i in range(n_measurements):
    if summer_months[i]:
        consumption_values[i] = np.random.uniform(summer_mean_kwh - summer_std_dev, summer_mean_kwh + summer_std_dev)
    elif winter_months[i]:
        consumption_values[i] = np.random.uniform(winter_mean_kwh - (yearly_max_kwh / 8.0), 
                                                    winter_mean_kwh + (yearly_max_kwh / 4.0))
    else: # Non-seasonal months, maintain yearly mean with slight variability
        consumption_values[i] = np.random.uniform(yearly_mean_kwh - (yearly_max_kwh / 16.0), 
                                                  yearly_mean_kwh + (yearly_max_kwh / 8.0))

# Clip values to ensure they're within acceptable range
consumption_values = np.clip(consumption_values, yearly_min_kwh, yearly_max_kwh)

# Format output as required
for i in range(n_measurements):
    print(f"{dates[i].strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')},{consumption_values[i]:.6f}")
```

This script first sets up arrays to track which months are summer and winter based on the given date ranges. It then uses NumPy's `random.uniform` function to generate energy consumption values for each hour, adjusting the standard deviation of these values depending on whether it's a summer or winter month. Consumption during non-seasonal months has slightly more variability around the yearly mean. Finally, all generated values are clipped to ensure they fall within the acceptable range.

Running this script will output 1440 lines in the required format, each representing hourly energy consumption for the specified building over the course of a year.
