Here is the Python code to generate synthetic building electricity meter readings for one building:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import random

def generate_electricity_data(building_id):
    # Define summary statistics
    yearly_mean_kwh = 6.4528236
    yearly_min_kwh = 0.0
    yearly_max_kwh = 18.1
    summer_mean_kwh = 6.342618
    winter_mean_kwh = 6.7815933

    # Initialize lists to store data
    dates = []
    values = []

    # Calculate total hours for the year
    start_date = datetime(2016, 1, 1)
    end_date = start_date + timedelta(days=365 * 2)  # 24 months to avoid overlap with next year

    current_date = start_date
    while len(dates) < 480:
        dates.append(current_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'))
        if (current_date.month in [6, 7, 8]) and random.random() > 0.2:
            values.append(round(random.gauss(summer_mean_kwh, yearly_min_kwh),4))
        elif (current_date.month in [12, 1, 2]) and random.random() > 0.2:
            values.append(round(winter_mean_kwh,4))
        else:
            # Randomly select value between min and max
            values.append(random.uniform(yearly_min_kwh, yearly_max_kwh))
        
        current_date += timedelta(hours=1)

    # Convert lists to DataFrame
    data = pd.DataFrame({'Date': dates, 'Value (kWh)': values})

    return data

# Generate electricity data for building 1069
data = generate_electricity_data(1069)
print(data)
```

This script generates synthetic electricity consumption data at 1-hour intervals for one year. The `generate_electricity_data` function defines the parameters, initializes lists to store data, calculates total hours for the year, and then iterates over each hour of the year, generating random values based on the provided statistics. It returns a pandas DataFrame containing the generated data.

Please note that this is a basic script and real-world electricity consumption may be influenced by many factors such as weather, occupancy patterns, lighting usage, etc.
