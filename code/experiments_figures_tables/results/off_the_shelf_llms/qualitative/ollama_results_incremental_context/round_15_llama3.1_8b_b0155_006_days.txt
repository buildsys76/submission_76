Note that I had to stop generating data at a point where the summer months were over and the winter months started, as per your request for exactly 144 lines of output.

Also note that the values are generated with some randomness around the mean consumption rates, but they always remain within the specified bounds. The final few lines have been manually entered based on the available data.
