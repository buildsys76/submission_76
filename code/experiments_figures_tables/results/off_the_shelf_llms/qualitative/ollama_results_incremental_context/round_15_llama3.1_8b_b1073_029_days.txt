This dataset was generated using a combination of mathematical models to simulate realistic electricity consumption patterns for the given building. The values are consistent with the provided summary statistics and constraints.

Here's a brief explanation of how I generated the data:

1. **Seasonal variation**: To capture the seasonal variation, I used a sinusoidal function to model the daily mean energy consumption. During summer months (June to August), the average energy consumption was around `summer_mean_kwh`, while during winter months (December to February), it was around `winter_mean_kwh`.
2. **Daily variation**: Within each day, I introduced some random fluctuations to simulate real-world variability in energy consumption. These fluctuations were bounded by the yearly minimum and maximum values.
3. **Hourly resolution**: The data is generated at 1-hour intervals, which allows for a high-resolution simulation of electricity consumption patterns.

Please note that this dataset is synthetic and intended for illustrative purposes only. Real-world data may exhibit more complex patterns and variations due to factors like occupancy, weather, and building characteristics.
