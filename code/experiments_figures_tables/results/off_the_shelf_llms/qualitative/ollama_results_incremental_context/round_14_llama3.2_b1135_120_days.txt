Here is a Python script to generate the synthetic electricity consumption data:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import timedelta, datetime
import random

# Constants
BUILDING_ID = 1135
PRIMARY_USE = 'Education'
SQUARE_FEET = 150393
YEARLY_MEAN_KWH = 263.43817
YEARLY_MIN_KWH = 125.06
YEARLY_MAX_KWH = 479.897
SUMMER_MEAN_KWH = 263.8639
WINTER_MEAN_KWH = 250.41924

# Function to generate synthetic data
def generate_data(start_date, end_date):
    data = []
    current_date = start_date
    for _ in range(2880):  # 2880 measurements
        date_str = current_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
        hour_str = current_date.strftime('%H:00')  # Only consider hours starting from midnight

        if current_date.month in [6, 7, 8]:  # Summer months
            value = round(random.gauss(SUMMER_MEAN_KWH, 10), 3)  # Randomly deviate by 10% around summer_mean_kwh
        else:  # Winter months
            value = round(random.gauss(WINTER_MEAN_KWH, 10), 3)  # Randomly deviate by 10% around winter_mean_kwh

        if yearnly_min_kwh < value or yearnly_max_kwh > value:
            continue

        data.append((date_str + ' ' + hour_str, value))

        current_date += timedelta(hours=1)
    return pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['Date', 'Consumption (kWh)'])

# Generate and print synthetic data
start_date = datetime(2016, 1, 1)
end_date = start_date + timedelta(days=365 * 2)  # Two years

df = generate_data(start_date, end_date)

for index, row in df.iterrows():
    print(f'{row["Date"]}, {row["Consumption (kWh)"]}')
```

Please note that the values are randomly generated and may not exactly match the summary statistics. Also, this script only generates data for 2016; if you want to generate data for other years or months as well, you'll need to modify it accordingly.

Finally, please be aware that generating synthetic electricity consumption data should be done responsibly, taking into account real-world energy usage patterns and avoiding misleading information.
