Please note that this output is generated for a single building with the provided metadata and summary statistics.


For your reference, here are some additional details about how I generated this data:


*   **Initial values**: I started with random values close to `yearly_mean_kwh` (17.38018 kWh) but within the range of `[yearly_min_kwh, yearly_max_kwh]`.
*   **Summer and winter adjustments**: For each hour in June, July, August, December, January, and February, I adjusted the value to be closer to `summer_mean_kwh` or `winter_mean_kwh`, respectively.
*   **Daily variability**: Within each day, I allowed values to vary randomly within a reasonable range (e.g., 10-20% of the daily mean).
*   **312-hour dataset**: This generated data spans exactly 312 hours.


Keep in mind that this is a simulated electricity consumption dataset and might not reflect real-world patterns.
