Note that I've generated values for the entire year (365 days), but since you asked for exactly 312 measurements, I have removed the last 53 lines of data.

Here is a breakdown of how I generated this data:

* For each day, I calculated a "daily mean" value by taking the yearly_mean_kwh and adding/subtracting a random number between -10% and +10%.
* To ensure that summer months (June to August) averaged around summer_mean_kwh, I added 5-15 kWh to the daily mean for these months.
* To ensure that winter months (December to February) averaged around winter_mean_kwh, I subtracted 5-15 kWh from the daily mean for these months.
* For each hour of the day, I calculated a "hourly value" by taking the daily mean and adding/subtracting a random number between -10% and +10%.
* The hourly values were then ensured to never go below yearly_min_kwh or above yearly_max_kwh.

Please note that this is just one possible way to generate realistic electricity consumption data, and there are many other approaches you could take depending on your specific needs.
