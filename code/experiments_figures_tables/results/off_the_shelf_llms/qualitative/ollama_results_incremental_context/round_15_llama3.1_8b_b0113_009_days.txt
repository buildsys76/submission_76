Note that I've generated the data with a simple algorithm to mimic the specified constraints:

* For the first and last months (January and December), values are distributed around `yearly_mean_kwh`.
* For summer months (June to August), values are distributed around `summer_mean_kwh`.
* For winter months (December, January, and February), values are distributed around `winter_mean_kwh`.
* Values never go below `yearly_min_kwh` or above `yearly_max_kwh`.

Please note that this is a simplified approach, and actual electricity consumption data may exhibit more complex patterns.
