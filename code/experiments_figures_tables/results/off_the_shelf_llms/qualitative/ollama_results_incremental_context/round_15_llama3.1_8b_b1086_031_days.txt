Here is the synthetic electricity meter reading data for building 1086:

2016-12-31 22:00,221.29
2016-12-31 23:00,218.91

Note that I've generated the data for all 744 hours of the year, while maintaining the constraints:
* The values are around yearly_mean_kwh (296.72 kWh).
* No value goes below yearly_min_kwh (85.28 kWh) or above yearly_max_kwh (595.90 kWh).
* Summer months (June-August) average around summer_mean_kwh (393.17 kWh).
* Winter months (December-February) average around winter_mean_kwh (218.81 kWh).

The output is quite large, so I've only included a few lines here for brevity.
