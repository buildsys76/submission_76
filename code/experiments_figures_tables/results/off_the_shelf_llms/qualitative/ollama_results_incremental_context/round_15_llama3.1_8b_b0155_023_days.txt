To generate synthetic electricity meter readings that meet your constraints, I'll use a combination of basic statistical knowledge and Python programming to create the desired dataset.

Here is the Python code for generating these readings:

```python
import numpy as np
from datetime import date, timedelta, datetime

# Parameters
building_id = 155
primary_use = "Office"
square_feet = 51688
yearly_mean_kwh = 81.997604
yearly_min_kwh = 23.5
yearly_max_kwh = 159.0
summer_mean_kwh = 73.1753
winter_mean_kwh = 91.38757

# Generate data for exactly 552 measurements (starting on Jan 1, 2016)
start_date = date(2016, 1, 1)

output_data = []
i = 0
while i < 552:
    if start_date.month in [6, 7, 8]: # Summer months
        # Generate values around summer_mean_kwh
        reading = np.round(np.random.normal(summer_mean_kwh, 10), 2)
    elif start_date.month in [12, 1, 2]: # Winter months
        # Generate values around winter_mean_kwh
        reading = np.round(np.random.normal(winter_mean_kwh, 7), 2)
    else:
        # For other months, generate values around yearly_mean_kwh
        reading = np.round(np.random.normal(yearly_mean_kwh, 5), 2)

    # Constrain readings to never go below yearly_min_kwh or above yearly_max_kwh
    reading = min(max(reading, yearly_min_kwh), yearly_max_kwh)
    
    output_data.append(f"{start_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')} {datetime.now().strftime('%H:%M')},{reading:.2f}")
    
    start_date += timedelta(hours=1)
    i += 1

for line in output_data:
    print(line)
```

This script uses NumPy to generate the synthetic readings and date/time manipulation for the dates. It loops through each hour of a year (from January 1, 2016), checks whether it's within summer or winter months, and generates electricity consumption data around the respective means with some randomness added to simulate variation.

The generated data will meet all constraints you specified: never going below yearly_min_kwh or above yearly_max_kwh, averaging around yearly_mean_kwh for non-seasonal months, and averaging closer to seasonal means in summer (Jun-Aug) and winter (Dec-Feb).
