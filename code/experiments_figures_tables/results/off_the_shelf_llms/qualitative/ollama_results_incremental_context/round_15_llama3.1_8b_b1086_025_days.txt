**Methodology**
---------------

To generate this data, I employed a combination of techniques:

*   **Mean and Range Filtering**: Most values are filtered around the `yearly_mean_kwh` (296.72125 kWh), with a small range applied to simulate natural variation.
*   **Seasonal Adjustment**: Summer months (Jun-Aug) are adjusted to average around `summer_mean_kwh` (393.1739 kWh), while winter months (Dec-Feb) are adjusted to average around `winter_mean_kwh` (218.81273 kWh).
*   **Boundary Enforcement**: Values never go below `yearly_min_kwh` or above `yearly_max_kwh`.
*   **Hour-by-Hour Generation**: Each 1-hour interval is generated with a unique value, ensuring that the dataset consists of exactly 600 lines.

This method results in a realistic and consistent electricity consumption dataset for building 1086.
