To generate the synthetic building electricity meter readings, I'll use a Python script that leverages the `numpy` and `pandas` libraries to create a time series of realistic values based on the provided constraints.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from datetime import timedelta

# Set parameters
building_id = 272
primary_use = 'Education'
square_feet = 4583
yearly_mean_kwh = 17.38018
yearly_min_kwh = 0.8
yearly_max_kwh = 74.32
summer_mean_kwh = 25.539513
winter_mean_kwh = 11.742976

# Generate time series for exactly 600 measurements, starting on 01 January 2016
start_date = pd.to_datetime('2016-01-01')
end_date = start_date + timedelta(days=599)

dates = [start_date + timedelta(days=i) for i in range(600)]

# Create a pandas DataFrame with the dates and corresponding values
np.random.seed(0)
summer_months = ['Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug']
winter_months = ['Dec', 'Jan', 'Feb']

values = []
for date in dates:
    # Determine if it's summer or winter month
    month = date.strftime('%b').lower()
    
    # Set mean value based on season
    if month in summer_months:
        mean_kwh = summer_mean_kwh
    elif month in winter_months:
        mean_kwh = winter_mean_kwh
    else:
        mean_kwh = yearly_mean_kwh
    
    # Generate a random value around the mean, within min and max bounds
    value = np.random.uniform(mean_kwh - 1.5, mean_kwh + 1.5)
    
    # Ensure never goes below yearly_min_kwh or above yearly_max_kwh
    value = max(yearly_min_kwh, min(value, yearly_max_kwh))
    
    values.append((date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'), value))

df = pd.DataFrame(values, columns=['Date', 'Value'])

# Output the full dataset as specified
print(df.to_csv(index=False, header=False, line_terminator='\n'))
```

When you run this script, it will output 600 lines of "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM,VALUE" format, where each value is a realistic electricity consumption measurement for the given building, adhering to the constraints.

Please note that running this code will produce the same synthetic data every time due to the fixed `np.random.seed(0)` initialization. If you want different synthetic data, you can change or remove this line and run it again.
