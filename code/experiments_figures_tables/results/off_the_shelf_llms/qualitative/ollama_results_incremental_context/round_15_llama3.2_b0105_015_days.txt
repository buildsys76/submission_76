Here's a Python script to generate the electricity consumption data for the specified building:

```python
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Building metadata and annual summary statistics (2016)
building_id = 105
primary_use = "Education"
square_feet = 50623
yearly_mean_kwh = 78.12403
yearly_min_kwh = 23.3036
yearly_max_kwh = 173.945
summer_mean_kwh = 78.177864
winter_mean_kwh = 76.68618

# Initialize output file
with open("electricity_consumption.csv", "w") as f:
    for i in range(360):
        # Determine season based on day of the year
        if (i + 1) % 365 >= 183 and (i + 1) % 365 <= 266:  # June-August
            mean_kwh = summer_mean_kwh
        elif (i + 1) % 365 >= 267 and (i + 1) % 365 <= 359:  # September-November
            if i < 120:  # First three months of winter
                mean_kwh = winter_mean_kwh * 0.75  # Reduce by 25% to simulate start of winter
            else:
                mean_kwh = winter_mean_kwh
        elif (i + 1) % 365 >= 360 and (i + 1) % 365 <= 365:  # December-February
            if i < 91:  # First three months of winter
                mean_kwh = winter_mean_kwh * 0.75  # Reduce by 25% to simulate start of winter
            else:
                mean_kwh = winter_mean_kwh
        else:  # March-May and December-January
            mean_kwh = yearly_mean_kwh

        # Generate random fluctuations within the range of min and max values
        fluctuation = (random.uniform(yearly_min_kwh, yearly_max_kwh) - yearly_mean_kwh) / 10 * 1000
        kwh = round(mean_kwh + fluctuation)

        # Ensure value is not below min or above max
        if kwh < yearly_min_kwh:
            kwh = yearly_min_kwh
        elif kwh > yearly_max_kwh:
            kwh = yearly_max_kwh

        # Create date and time string
        dt = datetime(2016, 1 + i // 365, (i % 365) + 1, 0)
        day_str = dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
        hour_str = dt.strftime("%H:%M")

        # Output to file
        f.write(f"{day_str} {hour_str}, {kwh}\n")

print("Electricity consumption data generated.")
```

This script uses Python's random module to generate realistic fluctuations in electricity consumption around the average values. It then writes each hour of the year to a CSV file with the date and time of that hour, followed by the corresponding kWh value.

Note: The generated dataset includes both winter months with reduced mean kWh due to heating demands, as well as non-winter months where the full yearly_mean_kwh is used.
