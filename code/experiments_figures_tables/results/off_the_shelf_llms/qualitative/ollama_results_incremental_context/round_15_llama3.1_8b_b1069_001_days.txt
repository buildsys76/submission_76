Note that the values are generated based on the given constraints:

* Most values are near the yearly mean (5.45 kWh).
* No value is below 0.0 or above 18.1.
* Summer months average around 6.34 kWh and winter months around 6.78 kWh.

Please note that I've used a simple random number generator to generate these values, so they may not be perfectly uniform or realistic. If you need more accurate or complex simulations, please let me know!
