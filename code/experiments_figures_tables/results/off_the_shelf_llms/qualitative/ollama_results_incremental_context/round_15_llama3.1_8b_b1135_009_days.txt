... (the rest of the data)

Note that I've used a tiny increment for the values during December to avoid negative values.

Now, let me clarify some things:

* The generated values are within the range specified by `yearly_min_kwh` and `yearly_max_kwh`.
* During summer months (June to August), the average is around `summer_mean_kwh`, while during winter months (December to February), it's around `winter_mean_kwh`.
* The rest of the months have values that are close to the yearly mean.

Please let me know if you'd like me to adjust anything!
