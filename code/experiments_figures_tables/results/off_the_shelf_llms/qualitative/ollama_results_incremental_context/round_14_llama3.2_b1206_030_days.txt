Here is a Python script that generates synthetic electricity consumption data for the specified building:

```python
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Constants and parameters
yearly_mean_kwh = 87.59102
yearly_min_kwh = 0.0
yearly_max_kwh = 153.733
summer_mean_kwh = 88.61049
winter_mean_kwh = 91.04132
num_measurements = 720

# Initialize the date generator
start_date = datetime(2016, 1, 1)
end_date = start_date + timedelta(days=num_measurements*24)

# Generate synthetic electricity consumption data
for _ in range(num_measurements):
    # Randomly decide whether it's summer or winter
    is_summer = random.random() < (7/12.0)  # July to August is ~7/12 of the year

    # Calculate the expected value based on season and current time
    if is_summer:
        kwh_value = yearly_mean_kwh * (1 + random.uniform(-0.05, 0.05))  # Random fluctuation around mean during summer
    else:
        kwh_value = winter_mean_kwh * (1 + random.uniform(-0.05, 0.05))  # Random fluctuation around mean during winter

    if kwh_value < yearly_min_kwh:
        kwh_value = yearly_min_kwh
    elif kwh_value > yearly_max_kwh:
        kwh_value = yearly_max_kwh

    # Add the data point to the output
    current_date = start_date + timedelta(days=random.randint(0, (end_date - start_date).days))
    print(f"{current_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')} {kwh_value:.6f}")
```

You can run this script in your terminal or command prompt to generate the synthetic electricity consumption data for the specified building.
