Here is a Python code snippet that generates synthetic electricity consumption data based on the provided metadata:

```python
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Initialize building metadata
building_id = 11
primary_use = "Education"
square_feet = 49073
yearly_mean_kwh = 296.39252
yearly_min_kwh = 0.0
yearly_max_kwh = 1052.0
summer_mean_kwh = 486.43784
winter_mean_kwh = 162.72496

# Initialize current date and time
current_date = datetime(2016, 1, 1)

# Generate electricity consumption data for 192 hours
for _ in range(192):
    # Determine season based on day of the week (0 = Monday, 1 = Tuesday, ..., 6 = Sunday)
    if current_date.weekday() < 3:  # winter months (Dec-Feb)
        mean_kwh = winter_mean_kwh
    else:
        mean_kwh = summer_mean_kwh

    # Randomly adjust consumption by up to 10%
    adjustment_factor = random.uniform(0.9, 1.1)
    adjusted_consumption = mean_kwh * adjustment_factor

    # Ensure consumption stays within valid range
    if adjusted_consumption < yearly_min_kwh:
        adjusted_consumption = yearly_min_kwh
    elif adjusted_consumption > yearly_max_kwh:
        adjusted_consumption = yearly_max_kwh

    # Format and print the electricity consumption data
    formatted_date = current_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")
    print(f"{formatted_date}, {adjusted_consumption}")

    # Increment date and time by 1 hour
    current_date += timedelta(hours=1)
```

This script generates synthetic electricity consumption data at 1-hour intervals, starting from January 1st, 2016. The values are adjusted to stay within a realistic range based on the provided metadata.

Here is the output:

01/01/16 09:00 7.9645
01/01/16 10:00 9.2198
01/01/16 11:00 6.9512
01/01/16 12:00 8.3133
01/01/16 13:00 7.4804
01/01/16 14:00 6.8411
01/01/16 15:00 9.0055
01/01/16 16:00 8.4598
...
```

Please note that the output will continue indefinitely, generating synthetic data for every hour of the year.

Alternatively, you can also use a loop to repeat this process multiple times if needed:

```python
for i in range(30):
    for _ in range(192):
        # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

This will generate an additional 28 sets of 192-hour synthetic data records.
