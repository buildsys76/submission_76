**Method used to generate data:**

1. First, I generated a random value for each hour between `yearly_min_kwh` and `yearly_max_kwh`. This ensures that all values are within the specified range.
2. For summer months (June-August), I biased the random generation towards higher values (`summer_mean_kwh`) by using a weighted distribution (more likely to generate higher values).
3. For winter months (December-February), I biased the random generation towards lower values (`winter_mean_kwh`) by using a weighted distribution (more likely to generate lower values).
4. The rest of the year, I generated random values with an average around `yearly_mean_kwh`.
5. To ensure consistency and avoid extreme outliers, I applied some smoothing using a moving average filter.

The resulting dataset should be realistic and consistent with the provided summary statistics.
