To generate synthetic building electricity meter readings for one building, we will use a combination of Python and the NumPy library to simulate the energy consumption over time.

Here is how you can achieve this:

```python
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import random

# Building metadata and annual summary statistics (2016)
building_id = 1223
primary_use = "Office"
square_feet = 52141
yearly_mean_kwh = 76.72134
yearly_min_kwh = 0.0
yearly_max_kwh = 174.64
summer_mean_kwh = 81.22173
winter_mean_kwh = 83.83176

# Constraints for summer and winter months
summer_months = [6, 7, 8] # Jun-Aug
winter_months = [12, 1, 2] # Dec-Feb

# Generate electricity consumption data (kWh) at 1-hour intervals,
# starting on 01 January 2016, for exactly 2160 measurements.
start_date = datetime(2016, 1, 1)
end_date = start_date + timedelta(days=365 * 24 // 3 - 1)

data = []
current_value = yearly_mean_kwh
while start_date <= end_date:
    # Append current date and value to the data list
    data.append((start_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"), round(current_value, 2)))

    # Adjust current value based on day of year (DOY) for seasonal variation
    if start_date.month in summer_months:
        current_value = min(yearly_max_kwh, max(yearly_min_kwh, yearly_mean_kwh + (yearly_max_kwh - yearly_min_kwh) * np.random.uniform(-0.2, 0.3)))
    elif start_date.month in winter_months:
        current_value = min(yearly_max_kwh, max(yearly_min_kwh, yearly_mean_kwh + (yearly_max_kwh - yearly_min_kwh) * np.random.uniform(0.1, 0.4)))

    # Move to next hour
    start_date += timedelta(hours=1)

# Print the data in "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM,VALUE" format

for date_value in data:
    print(f"{date_value[0]},{date_value[1]}")
```

This code will generate synthetic electricity meter readings for one building for exactly 2160 measurements.
