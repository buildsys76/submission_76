Here's a Python script that generates synthetic building electricity meter readings based on the provided metadata and annual summary statistics:

The script generates synthetic building electricity meter readings at 1-hour intervals, starting on January 1st, 2016, and ending on December 31st, 2017. The values are adjusted according to the summer and winter months as specified by the summary statistics.

Please note that due to the random nature of this simulation, there will be variation in the generated data compared to the actual consumption patterns observed for a real building.
