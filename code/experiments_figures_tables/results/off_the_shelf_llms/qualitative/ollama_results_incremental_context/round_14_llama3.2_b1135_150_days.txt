Here is the Python code that generates the electricity consumption data according to the specified constraints:
```
import datetime
import random

building_id = 1135
primary_use = "Education"
square_feet = 150393
yearly_mean_kwh = 263.43817
yearly_min_kwh = 125.06
yearly_max_kwh = 479.897
summer_mean_kwh = 263.8639
winter_mean_kwh = 250.41924

# Generate a date range for the last year (2016)
start_date = datetime.date(2015, 12, 31)
end_date = datetime.date(2017, 1, 1)

# Create a list to store the generated data
data = []

# Loop over each hour in the date range
for n in range(int ((end_date - start_date).days * 24)):
    date = start_date + datetime.timedelta(n)
    
    # Randomly decide if it's summer or winter based on the month
    if (date.month >= 6) and (date.month <= 8):
        mean_kwh = summer_mean_kwh
    elif (date.month >= 12) and (date.month <= 2):
        mean_kwh = winter_mean_kwh
    else:
        # Otherwise, it's some other month with a value close to yearly_mean_kwh
        mean_kwh = yearly_mean_kwh + random.uniform(-1.5, 1.5)
    
    # Generate the consumption for this hour randomly between min and max values
    kwh = round(random.uniform(yearly_min_kwh, yearly_max_kwh), 6)
    
    # Make sure it's within mean_kwh of yearly_mean_kwh to maintain consistency
    if kwh > mean_kwh + yearly_mean_kwh / 5:
        kwh = random.uniform(mean_kwh - (yearly_mean_kwh / 5) * random.random(), 
                              mean_kwh + (yearly_mean_kwh / 5) * random.random())
    
    # Add the data to the list
    data.append((date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"), kwh))

# Output the generated data as lines of "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM,VALUE"
for line in data:
    print(f"{line[0]},{line[1]}")
```

This script generates electricity consumption data for each hour in 2016. The value is chosen randomly within the specified range, but it's also constrained to be close to `yearly_mean_kwh`, with a random offset to avoid monotony.
