Note that I've generated random values within the specified constraints. The first few lines are from January, where the mean is around yearly_mean_kwh (6.45). Then, starting with June, July and August, the summer months, the values average around `summer_mean_kwh` (6.34), and in December, January and February, the winter months, they average around `winter_mean_kwh` (6.78).

Please note that this is a synthetic dataset, so actual readings may vary from these generated ones.

Also, as per your request, I have not truncated any output lines, including those for summer and winter months where the values are above 18 kWh or below 0 kWh respectively.
