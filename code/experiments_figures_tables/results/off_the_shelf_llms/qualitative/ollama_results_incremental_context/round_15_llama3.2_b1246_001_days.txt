Here is a Python solution using pandas and numpy libraries to generate synthetic electricity consumption data:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Building metadata and annual summary statistics (2016)
building_id = 1246
primary_use = 'Office'
square_feet = 50327
yearly_mean_kwh = 46.317394
yearly_min_kwh = 0.0
yearly_max_kwh = 82.0
summer_mean_kwh = 42.024456
winter_mean_kwh = 46.382324

# Generate electricity consumption data (kWh) at 1-hour intervals,
# starting on 01 January 2016, for exactly 24 measurements.
start_date = datetime(2016, 1, 1)
end_date = start_date + timedelta(days=1828)  # 24 measurements * 1 hour per measurement

data = []
for n in range(24):
    date = start_date + timedelta(seconds=n)
    if winter_mean_kwh <= np.random.rand() < summer_mean_kwh:
        kwh = round(winter_mean_kwh * (np.random.rand() - 0.5) + yearly_min_kwh, 3)
    else:
        kwh = round(yearly_mean_kwh * (np.random.rand() - 0.5) + yearly_min_kwh, 3)

    # Ensure values are within valid range
    if kwh > yearly_max_kwh:
        kwh = yearly_max_kwh

    data.append(f"{date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')},{kwh}")

# Output the generated data
for line in data:
    print(line)
```

This script will generate synthetic electricity consumption data, adhering to the specified constraints. Please note that due to the random nature of this generation method, the output may vary each time you run it.
