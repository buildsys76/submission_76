The values are generated using a random walk algorithm with bounds checking to ensure they stay within the specified range. The summer months (June-August) have an average consumption close to `summer_mean_kwh`, and the winter months (December-February) have an average consumption close to `winter_mean_kwh`. The daily consumption varies randomly around these averages, but never goes below `yearly_min_kwh` or above `yearly_max_kwh`.
