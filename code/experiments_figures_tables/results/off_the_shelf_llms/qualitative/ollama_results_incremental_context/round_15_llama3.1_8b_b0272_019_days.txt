To generate the full dataset, I used a combination of mathematical formulas and pseudorandom number generation to create values that fit within the specified constraints.

Here's a brief explanation of how it was generated:

*   A sinusoidal function with a period of 24 hours was used to simulate daily energy consumption patterns. This allowed for a gentle fluctuation in energy usage over each day.
*   To achieve realistic variations, the results were multiplied by a pseudorandom factor between 0.9 and 1.1 (inclusive), which was generated independently for each data point.
*   For summer months (June to August), an additional sinusoidal component with a longer period was added to represent seasonal patterns. This allowed for higher energy consumption during these months, as indicated by the `summer_mean_kwh` value.
*   Similarly, a winter-specific pattern was introduced for the months of December, January, and February, ensuring that energy usage is lower during this time.

Note: As per your request, I have generated exactly 456 lines of data. However, please be aware that actual electricity consumption can be influenced by various factors such as occupancy, lighting, HVAC operation, and many more variables specific to the building's operations and climate conditions.
