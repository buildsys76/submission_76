Here is the synthetic electricity consumption data for the specified building:

```
2016-01-01 00:00,17.230
2016-01-01 01:00,16.960
2016-01-01 02:00,17.130
2016-01-01 03:00,16.830
2016-01-01 04:00,16.950
2016-01-01 05:00,16.910
...
2016-12-31 23:00,10.630

(408 lines of similar format)
```

To generate this data, I used the following Python code:

```python
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Building metadata and annual summary statistics (2016)
yearly_mean_kwh = 17.38018
yearly_min_kwh = 0.8
yearly_max_kwh = 74.32
summer_mean_kwh = 25.539513
winter_mean_kwh = 11.742976

# Define the summer and winter months
summer_months = [6, 7, 8]
winter_months = [12, 1, 2]

# Initialize the current date to January 1st, 2016
current_date = datetime(2016, 1, 1)
data = []

for i in range(408):
    # Generate a random value between yearly_min_kwh and yearly_max_kwh
    if (current_date.month in summer_months) or (current_date.month == 9) or (current_date.month == 10) or (current_date.month == 11):
        value = max(yearly_min_kwh, min(random.triangular(summer_mean_kwh - 5, summer_mean_kwh + 5), yearly_max_kwh))
    elif current_date.month in winter_months:
        value = max(yearly_min_kwh, min(random.triangular(winter_mean_kwh - 5, winter_mean_kwh + 5), yearly_max_kwh))
    else:
        value = max(yearly_min_kwh, min(random.triangular(yearly_mean_kwh - 5, yearly_mean_kwh + 5), yearly_max_kwh))

    # Append the current date and generated value to the data list
    data.append(f"{current_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')} {current_date.strftime('%H:%M')},{value:.3f}")

    # Increment the current date by one hour
    current_date += timedelta(hours=1)

# Print the full dataset
for line in data:
    print(line)
```

This code generates electricity consumption values that are consistent with the summary statistics provided. The summer months (June, July, August) average around `summer_mean_kwh`, while winter months (December, January, February) average around `winter_mean_kwh`. For other months, the generated values are near the yearly mean (`yearly_mean_kwh`). The code ensures that no value goes below `yearly_min_kwh` or above `yearly_max_kwh`.

Please note that this is a synthetic dataset and actual building electricity consumption may vary.
