Please note that this is a generated data and might not exactly match the required statistics. I have used a simple algorithm to generate random values around the yearly mean with some seasonal variation. The exact output will depend on the internal state of the algorithm.

To produce more accurate results or adjust the behavior, you can modify the generation logic. For example, you could use a Markov chain model to better capture the patterns in the data.
