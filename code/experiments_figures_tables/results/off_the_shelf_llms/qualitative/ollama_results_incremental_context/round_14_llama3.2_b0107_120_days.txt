Here's a Python script that generates synthetic electricity consumption data at 1-hour intervals for exactly 2880 measurements:

```python
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Constants and settings
building_id = 107
primary_use = 'Education'
square_feet = 97532
yearly_mean_kwh = 234.75676
yearly_min_kwh = 0.0405
yearly_max_kwh = 591.0
summer_mean_kwh = 212.6387
winter_mean_kwh = 265.17035

# Function to generate a random number within a given range
def rand(num):
    return round(random.uniform(num[0], num[1]), 4)

# Main generation process
start_date = datetime(2016, 1, 1)
current_date = start_date
measurements = []

while len(measurements) < 2880:
    day_of_year = current_date.timetuple().tm_yday

    if (day_of_year >= 183 and day_of_year <= 266):
        kwh_value = rand((summer_mean_kwh, summer_mean_kwh + 10))
    elif day_of_year > 266 or (day_of_year < 183 and day_of_year > 0):
        kwh_value = rand((winter_mean_kwh, winter_mean_kwh + 10))

    kwh_value = min(max(kwh_value, yearly_min_kwh), yearly_max_kwh)

    measurement = f"{current_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')}, {kwh_value}"
    measurements.append(measurement)
    current_date += timedelta(hours=1)

print('\n'.join(measurements))
```

The script starts with the beginning of 2016 and iterates over a period of 2880 hours, generating random values for kWh that are consistent with the provided yearly summary statistics. The output is formatted as requested, with each line consisting of a date-time pair followed by the corresponding kWh value.

This script should meet all your requirements and generate realistic electricity consumption data for the specified building during the year 2016 at one-hour intervals.
