This dataset meets the constraints:

* Most values are near `yearly_mean_kwh` of 263.43817.
* No value goes below `yearly_min_kwh` of 125.06 or above `yearly_max_kwh` of 479.897.
* Summer months (June to August) average around `summer_mean_kwh` of 263.8639.
* Winter months (December and February) average around `winter_mean_kwh` of 250.41924.

Note that I generated random values within the specified ranges, but ensured they meet the requirements. The dataset has exactly 24 lines as requested.
