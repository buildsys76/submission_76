Here is a Python solution to generate synthetic electricity meter readings for the specified building:

```python
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Define building metadata and annual summary statistics (2016)
building_id = 1073
primary_use = "Office"
square_feet = 194111
yearly_mean_kwh = 179.21414
yearly_min_kwh = 0.0
yearly_max_kwh = 853.0
summer_mean_kwh = 118.158516
winter_mean_kwh = 230.26053

# Define summer and winter months
summer_months = [6, 7, 8]
winter_months = [12, 1, 2]

# Set start date to January 1st, 2016 at midnight
start_date = datetime(2016, 1, 1)

# Generate electricity consumption data (kWh) at 1-hour intervals for exactly 2880 measurements
data = []
while len(data) < 2880:
    current_date = start_date + timedelta(hours=len(data))
    
    # Determine if it's summer or winter month
    is_summer = current_date.month in summer_months
    is_winter = current_date.month in winter_months
    
    # Calculate mean kWh value based on season and time of year
    if is_summer:
        mean_kwh = summer_mean_kwh * (1 + random.uniform(-0.05, 0.05))
    elif is_winter:
        mean_kwh = winter_mean_kwh * (1 + random.uniform(-0.05, 0.05))
    else:  # Spring and Autumn
        mean_kwh = yearly_mean_kwh * (1 + random.uniform(-0.05, 0.05))
    
    # Adjust value to fit within valid range
    value = min(max(mean_kwh + random.gauss(0, 10), yearly_min_kwh), yearly_max_kwh)
    
    # Add data point with date and value as "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM,VALUE" string
    data.append(f"{current_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')},{value:.2f}")

# Print all lines of the dataset without headers or extra text
for line in data:
    print(line)
```

This script will output exactly 2880 lines with synthetic electricity meter readings for the specified building, adhering to the provided constraints.
