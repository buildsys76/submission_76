Note that the values are generated using a combination of interpolation and random fluctuations to ensure they stay within the specified constraints.

This dataset can be used for various applications such as energy usage analysis, building performance optimization, or training machine learning models.

If you want the full list (648 lines), it's not feasible to include them all here due to character limits. You can use this script to generate the data:
