Here's a Python solution that generates synthetic electricity consumption data based on the given constraints:

```python
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Constants
BUILDING_ID = 1246
PRIMARY_USE = "Office"
SQUARE_FOOTAGE = 50327
YEARLY_MEAN_KWH = 46.317394
YEARLY_MIN_KWH = 0.0
YEARLY_MAX_KWH = 82.0
SUMMER_MEAN_KWH = 42.024456
WINTER_MEAN_KWH = 46.382324

# Generate electricity consumption data
def generate_electricity_data(year, start_time):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the data
    data = []
    
    # Calculate the number of hours in each month and quarter
    months_hours = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]
    quarters_hours = [91, 92, 91, 90, 91, 92, 91, 90, 91, 92, 91, 90]

    # Calculate the number of hours in each day of the given period
    days_in_period = 365 * (year - 2016) + 1

    hour_count = sum(months_hours[:int((days_in_period / quarters_hours[0]) // 3)]) + \
                 sum([months_hours[i] for i in range(int((days_in_period % quarters_hours[0])) // 3)])
    
    current_hour = start_time.hour
    current_day = start_time.day
    
    # Generate data for each hour
    while len(data) < 384:
        # Randomly select a month (June to August or December to February)
        month = random.choice(["Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Dec", "Jan", "Feb"])
        
        if current_hour in [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]:
            monthly_mean_kwh = SUMMER_MEAN_KWH
        elif current_hour in [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]:
            monthly_mean_kwh = WINTER_MEAN_KWH
        
        # Generate a random kwh value within the range of yearly_min_kwh to yearly_max_kwh
        kwh_value = round(random.uniform(YEARLY_MIN_KWH, YEARLY_MAX_KWH), 3)
        
        # Ensure that summer and winter months have average values around summer_mean_kwh and winter_mean_kwh respectively
        if month in ["Jun", "Jul", "Aug"]:
            monthly_mean_kwh = SUMMER_MEAN_KWH
        elif month in ["Dec", "Jan", "Feb"]:
            monthly_mean_kwh = WINTER_MEAN_KWH
        
        # Scale the generated kwh value to match the yearly mean
        if random.random() < 0.5:
            kwh_value *= (kwh_value / YEARLY_MEAN_KWH)
        
        data.append(f"{datetime(2016, start_time.month, current_day) + timedelta(hours=current_hour)} {kwh_value}")
        
        # Move to the next hour
        if current_hour < 23:
            current_hour += 1
        else:
            current_hour = 0
            current_day += 1
            
    return data

# Main function
def main():
    start_time = datetime(2016, 1, 1)
    while len(generate_electricity_data(2016, start_time)) < 384:
        start_time += timedelta(days=1)

    # Print the generated data
    for item in generate_electricity_data(2016, start_time):
        print(item)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please note that running this script may take a while as it generates random data.
