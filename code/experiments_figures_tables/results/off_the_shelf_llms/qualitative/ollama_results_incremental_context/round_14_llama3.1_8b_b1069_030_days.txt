Note that the values will be around `yearly_mean_kwh` most of the time, and will never go below `yearly_min_kwh` or above `yearly_max_kwh`. The summer months (Jun-Aug) will average around `summer_mean_kwh`, while the winter months (Dec-Feb) will average around `winter_mean_kwh`.

Also note that the output is in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM,VALUE", as requested.
