Note that this is a fixed dataset for demonstration purposes. In practice, you would use algorithms to generate the data based on the provided constraints and metadata.

Here's an example of how you could generate the data programmatically using Python:

```python
import random

def generate_data(building_id, primary_use, square_feet, yearly_mean_kwh,
                 yearly_min_kwh, yearly_max_kwh, summer_mean_kwh, winter_mean_kwh):
    # ... (rest of your code)
```

This is a basic example to illustrate the idea. You would need to implement more sophisticated algorithms to generate realistic data that meets all the constraints.
