To generate electricity consumption data at 1-hour intervals for exactly 168 measurements, I'll use a Python script with some basic statistical calculations and random number generation to simulate realistic values based on the provided constraints.


```python
import datetime
import math
from random import randint, uniform

# Constants from building metadata
building_id = 1223
primary_use = 'Office'
square_feet = 52141

yearly_mean_kwh = 76.72134
yearly_min_kwh = 0.0
yearly_max_kwh = 174.64

summer_mean_kwh = 81.22173
winter_mean_kwh = 83.83176

# List to hold the generated values and dates for output
data_points = []

# Start date
start_date = datetime.datetime(2016, 1, 1)

# Calculate a value close to yearly mean
def generate_value(yearly_mean):
    # Apply some random deviation within the bounds of yearly_min_kwh to yearly_max_kwh
    min_bound = max(0.95 * yearly_mean, yearly_min_kwh)
    max_bound = min(1.05 * yearly_mean, yearly_max_kwh)

    return uniform(min_bound, max_bound)

# Generate and store data for each hour of the year (ignoring timezone complexities)
for i in range(168):
    date = start_date + datetime.timedelta(hours=i)
    
    # Determine season
    if date.month >= 6 and date.month <= 8:  # June to August, summer months
        mean_kwh = summer_mean_kwh
    elif date.month < 3 or date.month > 11:  # Not in the specified winter months (Dec, Jan, Feb)
        mean_kwh = yearly_mean_kwh  # Default back to yearly mean for other times of year
    else:
        mean_kwh = winter_mean_kwh
        
    value = generate_value(mean_kwh)

    data_points.append(f"{date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')},{value:.2f}")

# Output the generated data
for point in data_points:
    print(point)
```

This script will output 168 lines, each representing a 1-hour interval from January 1st, 2016, until after midnight on February 10th (168 hours). Each value is randomly generated within constraints to be realistic and consistent with the summary statistics provided for building 1223.
