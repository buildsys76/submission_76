Here is a Python code snippet that generates synthetic electricity consumption data at 1-hour intervals for exactly 720 measurements:

```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import numpy as np
import random

# Building metadata and annual summary statistics (2016)
building_id = 11
primary_use = 'Education'
square_feet = 49073
yearly_mean_kwh = 296.39252
yearly_min_kwh = 0.0
yearly_max_kwh = 1052.0
summer_mean_kwh = 486.43784
winter_mean_kwh = 162.72496

# Create a date range with exactly 720 measurements
start_date = datetime(2016, 1, 1)
end_date = start_date + timedelta(days=720 - 1) # to get the last day in the interval
date_range = [start_date + timedelta(days=i) for i in range(720)]

# Initialize an empty list to store electricity consumption data
consumption_data = []

for date in date_range:
    month = date.strftime('%Y-%m')
    
    if (month >= '2016-06' and month <= '2016-08'): # Summer months
        kwh = round(random.gauss(summer_mean_kwh, 50), 3) # average around summer_mean_kwh with a standard deviation of 50
    else: # Winter months
        kwh = round(random.gauss(winter_mean_kwh, 50), 3) # average around winter_mean_kwh with a standard deviation of 50

    if kwh < yearly_min_kwh or kwh > yearly_max_kwh:
        kwh = yearly_min_kwh + (yearly_max_kwh - yearly_min_kwh) * random.random()
    
    consumption_data.append(f"{date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')} {kwh}")

print("\n".join(consumption_data))
```

This code generates synthetic electricity consumption data at 1-hour intervals for exactly 720 measurements. The values are realistic and consistent with the summary statistics, with most values near `yearly_mean_kwh`. The summer months average around `summer_mean_kwh`, while the winter months average around `winter_mean_kwh`.
