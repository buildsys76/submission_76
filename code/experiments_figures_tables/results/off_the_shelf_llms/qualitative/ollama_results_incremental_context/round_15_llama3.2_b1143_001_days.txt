Here's how you can generate synthetic building electricity meter readings in Python:

```python
import datetime
import random

def generate_electricity_data(building_id, yearly_mean_kwh, yearly_min_kwh, yearly_max_kwh,
                              summer_mean_kwh, winter_mean_kwh):
    """
    Generates synthetic electricity data at 1-hour intervals.

    Args:
        building_id (int): Unique identifier for the building.
        yearly_mean_kwh (float): Average electricity consumption in kWh/year.
        yearly_min_kwh (float): Minimum electricity consumption in kWh/year.
        yearly_max_kwh (float): Maximum electricity consumption in kWh/year.
        summer_mean_kwh (float): Average electricity consumption during summer months in kWh.
        winter_mean_kwh (float): Average electricity consumption during winter months in kWh.

    Returns:
        list: List of strings representing the synthetic electricity data.
    """

    data = []

    # Generate 24 measurements
    for i in range(24):
        date = datetime.datetime(2016, 1 + i * 3, 1)
        
        if (date.month >= 6) and (date.month <= 8):  # Summer months
            consumption = round(summer_mean_kwh + random.uniform(-5, 5), 3)
        else:  # Winter months
            consumption = round(winter_mean_kwh + random.uniform(-5, 5), 3)

        # Ensure value is within valid range
        consumption = min(max(consumption, yearly_min_kwh), yearly_max_kwh)

        data.append(f"{date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')}, {consumption}")

    return data

# Usage
building_id = 1143
yearly_mean_kwh = 79.257515
yearly_min_kwh = 25.0
yearly_max_kwh = 187.0
summer_mean_kwh = 85.378174
winter_mean_kwh = 74.83288

data = generate_electricity_data(building_id, yearly_mean_kwh, yearly_min_kwh,
                                 yearly_max_kwh, summer_mean_kwh, winter_mean_kwh)

for line in data:
    print(line)
```

In this script, we first define a function `generate_electricity_data` that generates the synthetic electricity data. It takes in all the required parameters and returns a list of strings representing the synthetic electricity data.

Inside the function, we generate 24 measurements by iterating over the months from January to December. For each month, we check if it's summer or winter. If it's summer, we generate a consumption value that is approximately equal to `summer_mean_kwh` plus some random variation between -5 and 5 kWh.

We then ensure that the generated consumption value is within the valid range of `yearly_min_kwh` to `yearly_max_kwh`.

Finally, we print out each line of data in the required format.
