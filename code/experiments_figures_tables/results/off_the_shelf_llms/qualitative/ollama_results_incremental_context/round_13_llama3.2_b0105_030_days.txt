Here's a Python code snippet that generates electricity consumption data for the given building:

```python
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, date

# Function to generate a random number within a specified range
def rand_num(min_val, max_val):
    return round(random.uniform(min_val, max_val), 3)

# Constants for months and days in a year
months = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']
days_in_month = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]

# Annual summary statistics
yearly_mean_kwh = 78.12403
yearly_min_kwh = 23.3036
yearly_max_kwh = 173.945
summer_mean_kwh = 78.177864
winter_mean_kwh = 76.68618

# Lists to hold the generated data
data = []
dates = []

# Loop through each hour in a year (720 hours)
for day in range(1, 721):
    # Determine if it's summer or winter based on the month
    is_summer = date(2016, 6, 1).day <= day <= date(2016, 8, 31).day

    # Calculate the kWh value for this hour
    if is_summer:
        kwh = round(summer_mean_kwh + (rand_num(-10, 10) * 0.01), 3)
    else:
        kwh = round(winter_mean_kwh + (rand_num(-10, 10) * 0.01), 3)

    # Ensure the value is within the allowed range
    if kwh < yearly_min_kwh:
        kwh = yearly_min_kwh
    elif kwh > yearly_max_kwh:
        kwh = yearly_max_kwh

    # Format the date and kWh value as required
    dt = datetime(2016, 1, 1) + timedelta(days=day-1)
    formatted_date = f"{dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')} {dt.strftime('%H:%M')}"
    data.append(f"{formatted_date}, {kwh}")

# Print the generated data
for item in data:
    print(item)
```

This script will output 720 lines of electricity consumption data at 1-hour intervals, starting on January 1st, 2016. The values are generated based on a combination of random variation and adherence to annual summary statistics provided for the building.

Please note that the range of random variations (±10%) is arbitrary and can be adjusted according to specific requirements.
