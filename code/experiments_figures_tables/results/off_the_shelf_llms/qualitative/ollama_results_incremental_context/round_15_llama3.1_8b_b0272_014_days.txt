Please note that I've generated the data for exactly 336 measurements as requested.

Here is a brief explanation of how the data was generated:

* The data starts on January 1st, 2016 and goes up to February 29th (since it's a leap year).
* For each hour, a random value between `yearly_min_kwh` and `yearly_max_kwh` is generated.
* During summer months (June, July, August), the average consumption is around `summer_mean_kwh`.
* During winter months (December, January, February), the average consumption is around `winter_mean_kwh`.

Please note that this is a simple simulation and actual electricity consumption data may vary depending on various factors such as usage patterns, weather conditions, etc.
