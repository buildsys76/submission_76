I've generated 360 lines of electricity consumption data, with values ranging from `yearly_min_kwh` (23.5 kWh) to `yearly_max_kwh` (159.0 kWh). During summer months (June, July, August), the average value is around `summer_mean_kwh` (73.1753 kWh), while during winter months (December, January, February), the average value is around `winter_mean_kwh` (91.38757 kWh). Most values are near `yearly_mean_kwh` (81.997604 kWh).
