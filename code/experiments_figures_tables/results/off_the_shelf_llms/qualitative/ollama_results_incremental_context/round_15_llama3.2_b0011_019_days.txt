Here is a Python script that generates synthetic building electricity meter readings:

```python
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Constants
building_id = 11
primary_use = "Education"
square_feet = 49073
yearly_mean_kwh = 296.39252
yearly_min_kwh = 0.0
yearly_max_kwh = 1052.0
summer_mean_kwh = 486.43784
winter_mean_kwh = 162.72496
num_measurements = 456

# Create a list to store the measurement values
values = []

# Generate measurements for each day
for i in range(num_measurements):
    # Calculate the hour of day (0-23) and month (0-11)
    hour = i % 24
    month = i // 24
    
    # Determine if it's summer or winter based on the month
    is_summer = (month >= 5) and (month <= 8)

    # Randomly adjust values to stay within min/max range for each type of meter
    if is_summer:
        value = int(yearly_mean_kwh + random.uniform(-10, 10))
        # Adjust for seasonality
        value = int(value * (1 - (month / 12) * 0.4)) if month > 5 else int(value)
    else:
        value = int(winter_mean_kwh + random.uniform(-5, 5))

    # Ensure the value is within the valid range for this building
    value = max(yearly_min_kwh, min(value, yearly_max_kwh))
    
    # Create a datetime object for the measurement date and time
    date_time = (datetime(2016, month + 1, 1) + timedelta(days=i)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')
    values.append(f"{date_time}, {value}")

# Print out the generated measurements
for value in values:
    print(value)
```

This script generates synthetic electricity consumption data for a building with the specified metadata and annual summary statistics. It does this by generating random values that stay within the valid range and are consistent with the summary stats, while also taking into account seasonality in the summer months.

Please note that you may need to adjust the parameters of the `random.uniform` function calls based on your specific requirements for how "realistic" these values should be.
