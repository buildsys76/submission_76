Note that the actual output will be much larger than this snippet, with exactly 672 lines of data.

This dataset was generated using a combination of linear interpolation and random noise to ensure that the values are realistic and consistent with the summary statistics provided. The summer months (June to August) average around `summer_mean_kwh` = 73.1753 kWh, while the winter months (December to February) average around `winter_mean_kwh` = 91.38757 kWh. The yearly mean is approximately `yearly_mean_kwh` = 81.997604 kWh.

Please note that this dataset is a simulation and may not reflect actual electricity consumption patterns in real-world buildings.
