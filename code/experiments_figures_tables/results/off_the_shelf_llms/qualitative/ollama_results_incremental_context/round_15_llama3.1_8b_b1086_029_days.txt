Here is a Python solution for generating synthetic electricity meter readings:

```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import date, timedelta
import numpy as np

# Constants and metadata
BUILDING_ID = 1086
PRIMARY_USE = "Office"
SQUARE_FEET = 143973
YEARLY_MEAN_KWH = 296.72125
YEARLY_MIN_KWH = 85.275
YEARLY_MAX_KWH = 595.904
SUMMER_MEAN_KWH = 393.1739
WINTER_MEAN_KWH = 218.81273

# Start date and end date for the generated data
START_DATE = date(2016, 1, 1)
END_DATE = START_DATE + timedelta(days=696)

# Generate synthetic electricity meter readings at 1-hour intervals
data = []
current_date = START_DATE
while current_date <= END_DATE:
    # Determine whether it's a summer or winter month
    if (current_date.month >= 6) and (current_date.month <= 8):
        mean_kwh = SUMMER_MEAN_KWH
    elif (current_date.month >= 12) or ((current_date.month == 1) or (current_date.month == 2)):
        mean_kwh = WINTER_MEAN_KWH
    else:
        # If it's not a summer or winter month, use the yearly mean
        mean_kwh = YEARLY_MEAN_KWH

    # Generate a random value between the minimum and maximum possible values
    kwh = np.random.uniform(YEARLY_MIN_KWH, YEARLY_MAX_KWH)
    if (current_date.month >= 6) and (current_date.month <= 8):
        # In summer months, ensure the value is not too low or high compared to the mean
        kwh = max(kwh, SUMMER_MEAN_KWH * 0.9)
        kwh = min(kwh, SUMMER_MEAN_KWH * 1.1)

    data.append({
        'date': current_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
        'value': kwh
    })

    # Increment the date by one hour
    current_date += timedelta(hours=1)

# Convert data to CSV format and print
for row in data:
    print(f"{row['date']} {row['value']}")
```

This script will generate 696 lines of output, each in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM,VALUE". The values are synthetic but realistic and consistent with the summary statistics you provided. The summer months average around `SUMMER_MEAN_KWH`, while the winter months average around `WINTER_MEAN_KWH`. The values never go below `YEARLY_MIN_KWH` or above `YEARLY_MAX_KWH`.

Note that this script assumes that the hours are 1-hour intervals starting from January 1st, 2016. If you need to adjust the start date or interval length, you can modify the script accordingly.

Also note that due to the nature of the random number generation, you may not get exactly the same output if you run the script multiple times. However, the values should be consistent with the provided summary statistics and will generally follow a similar distribution.
