Here is a Python script to generate the synthetic building electricity meter readings:

```python
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Building metadata and annual summary statistics (2016)
building_id = 155
primary_use = "Office"
square_feet = 51688
yearly_mean_kwh = 81.997604
yearly_min_kwh = 23.5
yearly_max_kwh = 159.0
summer_mean_kwh = 73.1753
winter_mean_kwh = 91.38757

# Function to generate random values within the specified range
def rand_range(min_val, max_val):
    return round(random.uniform(min_val, max_val), 2)

# Generate electricity consumption data (kWh) at 1-hour intervals
data = []
start_date = datetime(2016, 1, 1)
for i in range(3600):
    date = start_date + timedelta(hours=i)
    if date.month in [6, 7, 8]: # Summer months (Jun-Aug)
        value = rand_range(summer_mean_kwh - 5, summer_mean_kwh + 5)
    elif date.month in [12, 1, 2]: # Winter months (Dec-Feb)
        value = rand_range(winter_mean_kwh - 5, winter_mean_kwh + 5)
    else: # Other months
        value = rand_range(yearly_mean_kwh - 10, yearly_mean_kwh + 10)
    
    if value < yearly_min_kwh:
        value = yearly_min_kwh
    elif value > yearly_max_kwh:
        value = yearly_max_kwh
    
    data.append(f"{date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')},{value:.2f}")

# Print the full dataset
for line in data:
    print(line)
```

This script will output 3600 lines of synthetic building electricity meter readings, one for each hour starting from January 1, 2016. The values are generated randomly within realistic ranges, ensuring that they never go below `yearly_min_kwh` or above `yearly_max_kwh`.
