Note that the values are generated based on a normal distribution with mean and standard deviation derived from the yearly_mean_kwh and yearly_min_kwh/max_kwh statistics to ensure that most values are near the yearly mean and never exceed the maximum or minimum limits. The summer and winter months will average around summer_mean_kwh and winter_mean_kwh respectively.

Please note, that this is a single run of a simple random number generator. You may get different results if you generate the data yourself.
