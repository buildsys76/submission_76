To generate synthetic building electricity meter readings, I'll use Python with its NumPy and Pandas libraries for efficient array operations and data manipulation. The task requires generating 168 measurements at one-hour intervals starting from January 1st, 2016, ensuring that most values are near the yearly mean consumption (263.43817 kWh), and not exceeding the minimum or maximum annual consumption limits.

Below is a Python code snippet designed to meet these requirements:

```python
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Building metadata
building_id = 1135
primary_use = "Education"
square_feet = 150393
yearly_mean_kwh = 263.43817
yearly_min_kwh = 125.06
yearly_max_kwh = 479.897
summer_mean_kwh = 263.8639
winter_mean_kwh = 250.41924

# Generate dates and values for 168 hours starting from January 1st, 2016
start_date = datetime(2016, 1, 1)
end_date = start_date + timedelta(days=3)  # To capture the first few days, then back to Jan 1
hours = np.arange(start_date.timestamp(), end_date.timestamp() - (3600), 3600)

# Ensure data spans full year, accounting for summer and winter averages differently
values = []
for hour in hours:
    date = datetime.fromtimestamp(hour)
    
    # Determine whether the month is part of summer or winter
    if date.month >= 6 and date.month <= 8:  # June to August
        value = np.random.uniform(low=summer_mean_kwh * 0.9, high=summer_mean_kwh * 1.1)  # Within 10% range around summer mean
    elif date.month in [12, 1, 2]:  # December, January, February
        value = np.random.uniform(low=winter_mean_kwh * 0.9, high=winter_mean_kwh * 1.1)  # Within 10% range around winter mean
    else:  # Any other month, use yearly average as a basis with some variation
        base_value = yearly_mean_kwh
        value = np.random.uniform(low=base_value * 0.9, high=base_value * 1.1)
        
    # Ensure it stays within the annual consumption limits
    value = max(yearly_min_kwh, min(value, yearly_max_kwh))
    
    values.append((date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"), round(value, 3)))  # Round to three decimal places for output

# Output the data as per the requirement
for line in values:
    print(f"{line[0]},{line[1]}")
```

This script first calculates the timestamp for each hour from January 1st, 2016. It then determines whether the current month is part of summer (June to August), winter (December, January, February), or another period, using different mean consumption values as a basis for generating synthetic readings within a reasonable range.

Finally, it ensures that generated values stay within the specified minimum and maximum annual consumption limits. The output will be a list of lines in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM,VALUE".
