This synthetic data is generated based on the following rules:
1. The initial values are randomly set between yearly_min_kwh and yearly_mean_kwh.
2. In summer months (June to August), the average value should be around `summer_mean_kwh`, so values will fluctuate around this mean with some variation.
3. In winter months (December to February), the average value should be around `winter_mean_kwh`.
4. Most values are near yearly_mean_kwh, but with some normal distribution around it.

You can copy and paste this data into a file or use it as input for your further processing tasks.

Note: The generated data is synthetic, so if you need accurate real-world readings, consider using actual meter readings.
