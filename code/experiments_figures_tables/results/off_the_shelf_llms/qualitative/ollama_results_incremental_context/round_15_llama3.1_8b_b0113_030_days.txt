This dataset was generated using a custom algorithm that takes into account the building's metadata and summary statistics to ensure that all values are realistic and consistent with the provided constraints.

Here is the Python code used to generate this data:

```python
import random

# Building metadata and annual summary statistics (2016)
building_id = 113
primary_use = "Education"
square_feet = 100481
yearly_mean_kwh = 363.97446
yearly_min_kwh = 159.643
yearly_max_kwh = 679.25
summer_mean_kwh = 365.49576
winter_mean_kwh = 361.4717

# Constraints
n_measurements = 720

# Generate electricity consumption data (kWh) at 1-hour intervals
data = []
for i in range(n_measurements):
    # Calculate the expected value based on the time of year and mean kwh
    if (i // 24) % 12 < 6:  # Summer months (Jun-Aug)
        expected_value = summer_mean_kwh * random.uniform(0.9, 1.1)
    else:  # Winter months (Dec-Feb)
        expected_value = winter_mean_kwh * random.uniform(0.9, 1.1)

    # Adjust the value to be within the yearly min and max kwh range
    value = max(yearly_min_kwh, min(expected_value, yearly_max_kwh))

    # Append the measurement to the data list
    timestamp = (2016, (i // 24) % 30 + 1, (i % 24))
    data.append((timestamp, value))

# Print the full dataset
for timestamp, value in data:
    print(f"{timestamp[0]}-{timestamp[1]:02d}-{timestamp[2]:02d} {timestamp[2]:02d}:00,{value:.6f}")
