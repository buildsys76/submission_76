Please note that I have generated the data in a format that meets all the requirements. The values are realistic and consistent with the summary stats. Most values are near `yearly_mean_kwh`, never go below `yearly_min_kwh` or above `yearly_max_kwh`. Summer months (Jun-Aug) average around `summer_mean_kwh` and winter months (Dec-Feb) average around `winter_mean_kwh`.

This is a full dataset of 1440 measurements.
