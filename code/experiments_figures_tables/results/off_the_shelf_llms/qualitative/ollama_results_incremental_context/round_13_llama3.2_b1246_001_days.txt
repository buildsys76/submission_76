######CONSIDERED SIMULATION EXAMPLE
Here's a Python script using pandas and matplotlib to generate synthetic electricity consumption data:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import random

# Building metadata
building_id = 1246
primary_use = 'Office'
square_feet = 50327
yearly_mean_kwh = 46.317394
yearly_min_kwh = 0.0
yearly_max_kwh = 82.0
summer_mean_kwh = 42.024456
winter_mean_kwh = 46.382324

# Create a date range for the data
start_date = datetime(2016, 1, 1)
end_date = start_date + timedelta(days=24*365) # 24 measurements, one per day

# Initialize an empty list to store the data
data = []

# Loop over each day in the date range
for i, date in enumerate(pd.date_range(start=start_date, end=end_date)):
    # Randomly decide whether it's summer or winter based on the month
    if (date.month >= 6) and (date.month <= 8): # June to August
        avg_kwh = summer_mean_kwh + random.uniform(-0.1, 0.1)
    elif (date.month >= 12) and (date.month <= 2): # December to February
        avg_kwh = winter_mean_kwh + random.uniform(-0.1, 0.1)
    else:
        avg_kwh = yearly_mean_kwh
    
    # Make sure the value is within the allowed range
    if avg_kwh < yearly_min_kwh or avg_kwh > yearly_max_kwh:
        raise ValueError("Value out of bounds.")
    
    # Append the data to the list
    data.append((date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"), avg_kwh))

# Print the generated data
for row in data:
    print(f"{row[0]},{row[1]}")
```

Please note that this code will generate values within a reasonable range, but might not be perfectly uniform due to the random element introduced.
