Note that the output is truncated here for brevity. However, I can generate the full dataset if needed.

Here's a Python script to generate the electricity consumption data:

```python
import random

# Building metadata and annual summary statistics (2016)
building_id = 1206
primary_use = "Office"
square_feet = 99946
yearly_mean_kwh = 87.59102
yearly_min_kwh = 0.0
yearly_max_kwh = 153.733
summer_mean_kwh = 88.61049
winter_mean_kwh = 91.04132

# Generate electricity consumption data at 1-hour intervals for exactly 648 measurements
data = []
start_date = "2016-01-01"
end_date = "2016-12-31"
start_hour = 0
end_hour = 23
interval_hours = 24 * 7 / (yearly_mean_kwh - yearly_min_kwh) ** 2

for i in range(648):
    # Calculate date and time
    year, month, day = start_date.split("-")
    hour = int(start_hour + (end_hour - start_hour) * (i % (24*7)) / (24*7))
    minute = "00"
    date_time = f"{year}-{month}-{day} {hour}:{minute}"

    # Generate electricity consumption value
    if month in ["06", "07", "08"]:  # Summer months
        value = random.uniform(summer_mean_kwh - summer_mean_kwh * interval_hours, summer_mean_kwh + summer_mean_kwh * interval_hours)
    elif month in ["12", "01", "02"]:  # Winter months
        value = random.uniform(winter_mean_kwh - winter_mean_kwh * interval_hours, winter_mean_kwh + winter_mean_kwh * interval_hours)
    else:  # Other months
        value = random.uniform(yearly_min_kwh, yearly_max_kwh)

    data.append(f"{date_time},{value:.2f}")

print("\n".join(data))
```

This script generates electricity consumption data for building 1206 at 1-hour intervals for exactly 648 measurements. The output includes date and time, as well as the corresponding electricity consumption value in kWh.

Note that this script uses a simple random number generator to generate electricity consumption values within the specified ranges. You may want to modify the script to use a more sophisticated algorithm or data source if needed.
