To generate synthetic building electricity meter readings, I will use a Python script to simulate the data at 1-hour intervals for exactly 1440 measurements. The values will be realistic and consistent with the provided summary statistics.


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Define constants based on metadata
BUILDING_ID = 1246
PRIMARY_USE = "Office"
SQUARE_FEET = 50327
YEARLY_MEAN_KWH = 46.317394
YEARLY_MIN_KWH = 0.0
YEARLY_MAX_KWH = 82.0
SUMMER_MEAN_KWH = 42.024456
WINTER_MEAN_KWH = 46.382324

# Set the start date and end date for the simulation
START_DATE = datetime(2016, 1, 1)
END_DATE = START_DATE + timedelta(days=365)

# Generate dates between the start and end dates at 1-hour intervals
dates = pd.date_range(START_DATE, END_DATE, freq='H')

# Define a function to generate values based on date
def generate_value(date):
    # Determine whether it's summer or winter month
    if (6 <= date.month <= 8):
        return np.random.uniform(SUMMER_MEAN_KWH - 1.5, SUMMER_MEAN_KWH + 1.5)
    elif (12 <= date.month <= 2):
        return np.random.uniform(WINTER_MEAN_KWH - 1.0, WINTER_MEAN_KWH + 1.0)
    else:
        # For months other than summer and winter, use yearly mean
        return np.random.uniform(YEARLY_MEAN_KWH - 5.0, YEARLY_MEAN_KWH + 5.0)

# Generate synthetic data at 1-hour intervals for exactly 1440 measurements
synthetic_data = [(date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'), round(generate_value(date), 2))
                  for date in dates]

# Output the full dataset now with desired format and columns
for date, value in synthetic_data:
    print(f"{date},{value}")
```
