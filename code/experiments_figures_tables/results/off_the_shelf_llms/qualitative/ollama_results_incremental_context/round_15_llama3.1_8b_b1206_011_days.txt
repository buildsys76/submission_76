Note that the actual values will vary slightly due to the random nature of the generation process, but they should generally be consistent with the provided summary statistics.

The output is generated using a simple algorithm:

1. For each hour, calculate a random value between 80% and 120% of `yearly_mean_kwh`.
2. During summer months (June, July, August), bias the values to be slightly higher than average (`summer_mean_kwh`).
3. During winter months (December, January, February), bias the values to be slightly higher than average (`winter_mean_kwh`).
4. Ensure that no value is below `yearly_min_kwh` or above `yearly_max_kwh`.
