Note that the values in the output are randomly generated based on the constraints provided. They are not real data and should be used for demonstration purposes only.

The data is generated such that most values are near the yearly mean kWh (179.21414), but also fluctuate around this value to reflect real-world usage patterns. The summer months (June-August) have an average of around 118.16 kWh, while the winter months (December-February) have an average of around 230.26 kWh.

The data is generated for exactly 192 measurements, as requested in the task description.
