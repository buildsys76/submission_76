**Electricity Consumption Data Generation**

Below is a Python solution using the `random` module to generate realistic electricity consumption data at 1-hour intervals for the specified building, adhering to the given constraints and statistics.


```python
import datetime
import random

# Building metadata
building_id = 155
primary_use = "Office"
square_feet = 51688
yearly_mean_kwh = 81.997604
yearly_min_kwh = 23.5
yearly_max_kwh = 159.0
summer_mean_kwh = 73.1753
winter_mean_kwh = 91.38757

# Number of data points to generate
n_data_points = 432

# Calculate day and month ranges for summer and winter months
summer_months = [6, 7, 8]
winter_months = [12, 1, 2]

# Function to calculate season-specific mean values based on month
def get_seasonal_mean(month):
    if month in summer_months:
        return summer_mean_kwh
    elif month in winter_months:
        return winter_mean_kwh
    else:
        return yearly_mean_kwh

# Generate data points at 1-hour intervals
data = []
start_date = datetime.date(2016, 1, 1)
end_date = start_date + datetime.timedelta(days=n_data_points - 1)

for n in range(n_data_points):
    date = start_date + datetime.timedelta(n)
    
    # Get season-specific mean value based on month
    seasonal_mean_kwh = get_seasonal_mean(date.month)
    
    # Generate a random value within the yearly min and max kwh, but closer to the seasonal mean or yearly mean
    if seasonal_mean_kwh != yearly_mean_kwh:
        # Use a weighted distribution where values near the seasonal mean are more likely
        lower_bound = max(yearly_min_kwh, seasonal_mean_kwh - 5)
        upper_bound = min(yearly_max_kwh, seasonal_mean_kwh + 5)
    else:
        # If we're using the yearly mean, use a slightly wider range to account for variability throughout the year
        lower_bound = yearly_min_kwh
        upper_bound = yearly_max_kwh
        
    value = round(random.uniform(lower_bound, upper_bound), 2)
    
    data.append(f"{date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')} {hour:02d}:{minute:02d},{value:.2f}")

# Ensure the output has exactly 432 lines
print("\n".join(data))
```

The solution defines a function `get_seasonal_mean(month)` to calculate season-specific mean values based on the month, ensuring that summer and winter months average around their respective specified means. The main loop generates data points at 1-hour intervals, using random values within the yearly min and max kwh ranges but closer to the seasonal or yearly mean as applicable.
