I'll use Python to generate the electricity consumption data.


```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import timedelta, datetime

# Define building metadata and annual summary statistics
building_id = 272
primary_use = "Education"
square_feet = 4583
yearly_mean_kwh = 17.38018
yearly_min_kwh = 0.8
yearly_max_kwh = 74.32
summer_mean_kwh = 25.539513
winter_mean_kwh = 11.742976

# Define summer and winter months
summer_months = [6, 7, 8]
winter_months = [12, 1, 2]

# Create a list to store the electricity consumption data
data = []

# Loop through each hour of the year (01 Jan 2016 - 31 Dec 2016)
start_date = datetime(2016, 1, 1)
end_date = start_date + timedelta(days=365)
current_date = start_date

while current_date <= end_date:
    # Get month and day of week
    month = current_date.month
    day_week = current_date.weekday()

    # Check if summer or winter month
    is_summer = month in summer_months
    is_winter = month in winter_months

    # Calculate mean kwh based on season
    if is_summer:
        mean_kwh = summer_mean_kwh
    elif is_winter:
        mean_kwh = winter_mean_kwh
    else:
        mean_kwh = yearly_mean_kwh

    # Apply a slight random variation to the mean kwh value
    value = round(mean_kwh + (0.2 - 0.1) * (random.random() - 0.5), 2)

    # Ensure value is within allowed range
    value = max(yearly_min_kwh, min(value, yearly_max_kwh))

    # Add value to data list with formatted date string
    data.append(f"{current_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')},{value:.2f}")

    current_date += timedelta(hours=1)

# Print each line of the dataset
for line in data:
    print(line)
```
