To generate the full dataset of exactly 432 lines (1 line per hour), I have followed these steps:

* Start with January 1st, 2016, at 00:00 and end with December 31st, 2016, at 23:00, which covers a total of 365 days.
* Within each day, generate values ranging from the yearly minimum (125.06 kWh) to the yearly maximum (479.897 kWh).
* Use a simple random number generator to produce values within this range for each hour.
* For summer months (June-August), ensure that the mean value is close to the summer mean (263.8639 kWh).
* For winter months (December-February), ensure that the mean value is close to the winter mean (250.41924 kWh).

Note: This approach will generate a large number of values below the yearly minimum and above the yearly maximum, so you may want to adjust it to better fit your needs.

Also note that this is a simplified approach and real-world data generation might require more sophisticated techniques, such as using a distribution (e.g., normal distribution) or incorporating additional factors like temperature, humidity, or other environmental variables.
