Here's a Python script that can generate synthetic building electricity meter readings based on the provided metadata and constraints:

```python
import random
import datetime

def generate_electricity_data(year, mean_kwh, min_kwh, max_kwh):
    start_date = datetime.datetime(year, 1, 1)
    end_date = start_date + datetime.timedelta(days=365*10) # 10 years for now
    
    data_points = []
    
    while start_date <= end_date:
        if (start_date.month in [6, 7, 8]) or (start_date.month == 12): # Summer
            kwh_consumption = random.gauss(mean_kwh, mean_kwh/5) # Average around summer_mean_kwh with some variation
        else: # Winter
            kwh_consumption = random.gauss(mean_kwh, mean_kwh/10) # Average around winter_mean_kwh with less variation
        
        # Ensure that the generated value is within min_kwh and max_kwh boundaries
        if kwh_consumption < min_kwh:
            kwh_consumption = round(min_kwh + (kwh_consumption - min_kwh)*10000/10, 5) # Round to avoid decimal precision issues
        elif kwh_consumption > max_kwh:
            kwh_consumption = round(max_kwh - ((kwh_consumption - max_kwh)*10000/10), 5)
        
        data_points.append((start_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'), str(kwh_consumption)))
        
        start_date += datetime.timedelta(hours=1)

    return '\n'.join([f'{date} {consumption}' for date, consumption in data_points])

year = 2016
mean_kwh = 17.38018
min_kwh = 0.8
max_kwh = 74.32

print(generate_electricity_data(year, mean_kwh, min_kwh, max_kwh))
```

Please note that the generated data may vary slightly each time you run the script due to the random nature of the generation process. Also, keep in mind that this is a basic implementation and might not perfectly match the provided metadata, especially considering that real-world electricity consumption can exhibit more complex patterns than what's represented here.
