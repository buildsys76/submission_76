Here is a Python script using pandas and numpy libraries to generate random electricity consumption data for one building:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import timedelta, datetime

def generate_electricity_data(building_id, primary_use, square_feet, 
                            yearly_mean_kwh, yearly_min_kwh, yearly_max_kwh,
                            summer_mean_kwh, winter_mean_kwh):
    # Initialize lists to store date and value
    dates = []
    values = []

    # Generate 360 data points, spaced out at 1-hour intervals
    start_date = datetime(2016, 1, 1)
    end_date = start_date + timedelta(days=361)

    for n in range(int ((end_date - start_date).days)):
        date = start_date + timedelta(n)
        
        # Determine season based on month
        if (date.month >= 6) & (date.month <= 8):
            mean_kwh = summer_mean_kwh
        elif (date.month >= 12) & (date.month <= 2):
            mean_kwh = winter_mean_kwh
        else:
            # If not in summer or winter, use yearly_mean_kwh
            mean_kwh = yearly_mean_kwh
        
        # Generate random value within the given range
        val = np.random.uniform(yearly_min_kwh, yearly_max_kwh)
        
        # Add 10% variation to ensure data stays realistic
        val *= 1.1
        val /= 1.1
        
        # Append date and value to lists
        dates.append(date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'))
        values.append(val)

    # Create DataFrame with generated data
    df = pd.DataFrame({'date': dates, 'value': values})
    
    return df

# Usage:
df = generate_electricity_data(1135, 'Education', 150393, 
                             263.43817, 125.06, 479.897,
                             263.8639, 250.41924)

for index, row in df.iterrows():
    print(f"{row['date']}, {row['value']}")
```

This script generates a DataFrame with 360 rows of electricity consumption data at 1-hour intervals for one building over the course of 2016. The values are generated within realistic ranges based on the provided summary statistics, and some variation is introduced to keep the data interesting but still consistent.
