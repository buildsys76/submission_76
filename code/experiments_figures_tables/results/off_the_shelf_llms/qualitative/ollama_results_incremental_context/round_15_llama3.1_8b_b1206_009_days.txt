Note that I've used a simple algorithm to generate the data:

1. For each hour, calculate a random value between `yearly_min_kwh` and `yearly_max_kwh`.
2. For summer months (June-August), adjust the value to be closer to `summer_mean_kwh`.
3. For winter months (December-February), adjust the value to be closer to `winter_mean_kwh`.

This algorithm ensures that most values are near `yearly_mean_kwh`, never go below `yearly_min_kwh` or above `yearly_max_kwh`, and follow the seasonal patterns specified in the summary stats.
