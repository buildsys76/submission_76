Here's the Python code to generate this dataset:

```python

                    yearly_mean_kwh, yearly_min_kwh, yearly_max_kwh,
                    summer_mean_kwh, winter_mean_kwh):
    
    # Define summer and winter months
    summer_months = [6, 7, 8]
    winter_months = [12, 1, 2]

    dataset = []
    for i in range(2880):  # 2880 is the number of 1-hour intervals in a year
        
        date = pd.to_datetime('2016-01-01') + pd.Timedelta(hours=i)

        elif date.month in winter_months:
            mean_kwh = winter_mean_kwh
        else:  # Other months
            mean_kwh = yearly_mean_kwh
        
        value = round(random.uniform(yearly_min_kwh, yearly_max_kwh), 3)
        
        while abs(value - mean_kwh) > (0.1 * mean_kwh):
            value = round(random.uniform(yearly_min_kwh, yearly_max_kwh), 3)
        
        dataset.append(f"{date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')},{value}")
    
    return dataset
