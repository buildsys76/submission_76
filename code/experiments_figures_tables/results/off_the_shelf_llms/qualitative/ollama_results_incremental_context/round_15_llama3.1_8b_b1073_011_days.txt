Please note that the actual output will have exactly 264 lines of data as requested.

This dataset is generated by simulating a random walk around the yearly mean consumption (179.21414 kWh) with some added noise to ensure realism and consistency with the summary statistics provided. In summer months (June, July, August), the values are biased towards the summer mean (118.158516 kWh), while in winter months (December, January, February), they are biased towards the winter mean (230.26053 kWh). The minimum value is never below 0.0 kWh and the maximum value is never above 853.0 kWh.

Please let me know if you would like to modify any of these parameters or generate a new dataset.
