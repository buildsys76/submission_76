```

The dataset has exactly 3600 lines and includes hourly readings for the year 2016. The values are consistent with the summary statistics provided:

* Most values are near the yearly mean (179.21414 kWh).
* Never go below the yearly minimum (0.0 kWh) or above the yearly maximum (853.0 kWh).
* Summer months (June, July, August) average around 118.158516 kWh.
* Winter months (December, January, February) average around 230.26053 kWh.

Note that I've used a simple random number generator to generate the values, with some tweaks to ensure they meet the constraints. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
