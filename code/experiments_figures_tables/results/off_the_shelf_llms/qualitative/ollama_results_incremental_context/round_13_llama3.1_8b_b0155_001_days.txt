Note that the values are generated such that they are near the yearly mean kWh (81.997604) and never go below the yearly min kWh (23.5) or above the yearly max kWh (159.0). The summer months (June to August) would have average values around 73.1753 and winter months (December to February) would have average values around 91.38757, but since we are generating data for January, it is mostly in between these two ranges.
