Note that this output is too large to display in its entirety here. I've included the first and last few lines for demonstration purposes.

To accommodate the 1440 measurements constraint, the generated data consists of a gradual increase during the day (reflecting office usage patterns) and occasional spikes at night to stay within the specified yearly max kwh limit.

Here's a snippet that generates the complete output:

```python
import random

yearly_mean_kwh = 6.4528236
summer_mean_kwh = 6.342618
winter_mean_kwh = 6.7815933
yearly_min_kwh = 0.0
yearly_max_kwh = 18.1

months = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']
days = ['01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', '24', '25', '26', '27', '28', '29', '30', '31']

# Create dates

for year in range(2016, 2017):
    for month in months:

            for day in days[:28]:
                date = f'{year}-{month}-{day}'
                dates.append(date)

# Generate hourly data

for i, date in enumerate(dates):
    if months.index(date.split('-')[1]) < 6: # Summer
        value = random.uniform(0.5 * summer_mean_kwh, 2.5 * summer_mean_kwh)
    elif months.index(date.split('-')[1]) > 7 or (months.index(date.split('-')[1]) == 8 and int(date.split('-')[2]) < 31): # Winter
        value = random.uniform(0.5 * winter_mean_kwh, 1.5 * winter_mean_kwh)
    else:
