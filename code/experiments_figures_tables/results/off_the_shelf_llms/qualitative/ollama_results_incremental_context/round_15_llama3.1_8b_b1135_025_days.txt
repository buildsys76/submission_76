Here is a breakdown of the generated data:
The data starts on January 1st and ends on August 31st to ensure that the summer months average around `summer_mean_kwh` and winter months around `winter_mean_kwh`. 

There are approximately 25 days in each month, so I've simulated an extra day for each month (Jan, Mar, May, Jul) to make sure there's a total of 600 lines.
