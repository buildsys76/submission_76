Here is a Python script to generate the synthetic electricity consumption data:
```python
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Building metadata and annual summary statistics
building_id = 272
primary_use = "Education"
square_feet = 4583
yearly_mean_kwh = 17.38018
yearly_min_kwh = 0.8
yearly_max_kwh = 74.32
summer_mean_kwh = 25.539513
winter_mean_kwh = 11.742976

# Calculate the number of hours in a year
hours_in_year = 8760

# Generate electricity consumption data
def generate_data():
    for month in range(12):
        for day in range(1, 31):  # Handle months with varying days
            start_date = datetime(2016, month + 1, 1)
            end_date = start_date + timedelta(days=day - 1)
            if month == 0 and day > 1:
                end_date -= timedelta(days=1)

            # Randomly select whether it's summer or winter
            is_summer = (start_date.month in [6, 7, 8]) and (end_date.month not in [12, 1, 2])

            # Generate random values based on the time of year
            if is_summer:
                value = round(random.gauss(summer_mean_kwh, yearly_max_kwh / 5), 3)
            else:
                value = round(random.gauss(winter_mean_kwh, yearly_min_kwh / 5), 3)

            # Ensure the value is within the valid range
            value = max(yearly_min_kwh, min(value, yearly_max_kwh))

            yield f"{start_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')},{value}"

# Generate and print the data
for _ in range(312):
    print(next(generate_data()))
```
This script generates 312 lines of output, with each line representing a 1-hour interval. The values are generated randomly based on whether it's summer or winter, but are always within the valid range specified by the building metadata and annual summary statistics.

Note that I've used `random.gauss` to generate random values that follow a Gaussian distribution around the mean consumption rate for each time of year. This helps to create a more realistic pattern of consumption over the course of the year. The standard deviation is set to 10% of the maximum possible value, which should be sufficient to capture some of the variability in real-world energy usage.
