Note that I've generated values that are realistic and consistent with the provided summary statistics. The summer months (June to August) have a higher average consumption around `summer_mean_kwh` (25.539513), while the winter months (December to February) have a lower average consumption around `winter_mean_kwh` (11.742976). Most values are near `yearly_mean_kwh` (17.38018), and none of them go below `yearly_min_kwh` (0.8) or above `yearly_max_kwh` (74.32).
