Here is a sample Python code snippet that can generate these synthetic readings:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import date, timedelta

# Define parameters
building_id = 1073
primary_use = "Office"
square_feet = 194111
yearly_mean_kwh = 179.21414
yearly_min_kwh = 0.0
yearly_max_kwh = 853.0
summer_mean_kwh = 118.158516
winter_mean_kwh = 230.26053

# Define dates range
start_date = date(2016, 1, 1)
end_date = date(2016, 12, 31)
delta = timedelta(hours=1)

# Generate synthetic readings
readings = []
current_date = start_date
while current_date <= end_date:
    # Determine season
    if (current_date.month >= 6) and (current_date.month <= 8):
        target_mean_kwh = summer_mean_kwh
    elif (current_date.month >= 12) or (current_date.month <= 2):
        target_mean_kwh = winter_mean_kwh
    else:
        target_mean_kwh = yearly_mean_kwh

    # Generate random value within range of min and max possible values for the building
    reading = np.random.uniform(yearly_min_kwh, yearly_max_kwh)
    
    # Make sure it is close to the target mean (seasonal or annual) with some variance added
    reading = target_mean_kwh + (np.random.normal(0, 20) * 1.5)

    readings.append((current_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"), round(readings[-1][1],2)))

    current_date += delta

# Ensure the last value is within range
readings[-1] = (readings[-1][0], min(max(float(readings[-1][1]), yearly_min_kwh), yearly_max_kwh))

print('\n'.join([f"{reading[0]},{reading[1]}" for reading in readings]))
```

Note: This code uses `numpy` to generate random numbers and `pandas` is not actually needed but included as it's a common practice.
