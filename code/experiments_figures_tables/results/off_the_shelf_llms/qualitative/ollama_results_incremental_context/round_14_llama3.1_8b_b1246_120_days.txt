To generate the synthetic building electricity meter readings, I will use a Python script that takes into account the constraints provided.


```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import numpy as np


# Building metadata and annual summary statistics (2016)
yearly_mean_kwh = 46.317394
yearly_min_kwh = 0.0
yearly_max_kwh = 82.0
summer_mean_kwh = 42.024456
winter_mean_kwh = 46.382324


# Generate dates for exactly 2880 measurements starting on 01 January 2016
start_date = datetime(2016, 1, 1)
end_date = start_date + timedelta(days=365) # Assuming 365 days in a year (leap years are considered)


dates = []
values = []

current_date = start_date


for _ in range(2880):
    dates.append(current_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"))
    
    if current_date.month in [6, 7, 8]:
        # If it's summer, draw a value from the normal distribution with mean = summer_mean_kwh
        value = np.random.normal(loc=summer_mean_kwh, scale=10)  # Scale should be small enough to keep values within range
    elif current_date.month in [12, 1, 2]:
        # If it's winter, draw a value from the normal distribution with mean = winter_mean_kwh
        value = np.random.normal(loc=winter_mean_kwh, scale=10)
    else:
        # For other months, draw a value from the normal distribution with mean = yearly_mean_kwh
        value = np.random.normal(loc=yearly_mean_kwh, scale=5)

    # Clip the generated value to ensure it doesn't go below yearly_min_kwh or above yearly_max_kwh
    value = max(yearly_min_kwh, min(value, yearly_max_kwh))
    
    values.append(value)
    
    current_date += timedelta(hours=1)


# Print each line of "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM,VALUE"
for date, value in zip(dates, values):
    print(f"{date},{value:.2f}")
```


This script generates synthetic electricity meter readings for the specified building between January 1st, 2016, and December 31st, 2016. The generated values are based on normal distributions with means equal to the yearly mean and summer/winter means provided in the summary statistics. Values are clipped to ensure they stay within the range of [yearly_min_kwh, yearly_max_kwh].
