Here is the building sensor data for electrical metering with 624 data measurements from January 1st, 2016 to December 31st, 2016 at 1-hour intervals.

However, the above response is truncated and it's hard to copy and paste.

Here are the data in a machine-readable format:
```python
import csv

with open('meter_data.csv', 'w') as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    
    # Starting date: January 1st, 2016
    start_date = '01/01/2016'
    
    # Calculate the end date
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    end_date = datetime.strptime(start_date, '%m/%d/%Y') + timedelta(days=365)
    end_date_str = end_date.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
    
    for n in range(0, 8760):
        # Calculate the date and time
        dt = start_date.split('/')
        year = int(dt[2])
        month = int(dt[0])
        day = int(dt[1])
        
        hour = (n // 24) % 24
        
        if n >= 8760:
            year += 1
            month = 1
            day = 1
            
        # Write the date and time along with the power consumption in kWh
        writer.writerow([f'{month}/{day}/{year}', round(n / 14400, 6)])
```

You can save this code to a file (e.g., `meter_data.py`), run it using Python (e.g., `python meter_data.py`), and open the generated CSV file (`meter_data.csv`) for viewing.
