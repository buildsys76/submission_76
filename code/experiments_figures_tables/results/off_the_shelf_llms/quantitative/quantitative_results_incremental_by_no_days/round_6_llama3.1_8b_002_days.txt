This data represents the electrical consumption of a building with an area of 10000 sq feet over the first two days of January, at 1-hour intervals. Each line is separated by a comma and includes:

- Date (in `YYYY/MM/DD` format)
- Time (in `HH:MM` format)
- Electrical measurement in kWh (at each time interval)

Note that this data is generated randomly for illustration purposes only.
