I can generate building sensor data for you. Here is a Python script that generates electrical metering data for a 10,000 sq foot building, starting from January 1st, 2016, with hourly intervals:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Define constants
building_size = 10000  # in square feet
hourly_usage_rate = 0.2  # in kWh/sq ft/hour
start_date = '2016-01-01'
end_date = '2017-01-01'

# Generate data
data = []
current_date = datetime.strptime(start_date, '%Y-%m-%d')
while current_date < end_date:
    date_str = current_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:00')
    usage_kwh = building_size * hourly_usage_rate / 24
    data.append((date_str, usage_kwh))
    current_date += timedelta(hours=1)

# Create dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['Date', 'Usage (kWh)'])

# Print dataframe
print(df)
```

This script generates a dataset with the specified parameters and prints it as a pandas DataFrame. Each row represents an hourly measurement of electricity usage for the building. 

The output will be 336 rows long, one for each hour between January 1st, 2016, and January 1st, 2017.

Please note that this is a simple model and actual energy consumption patterns may vary based on several factors like time of day, seasonality, occupancy rate, etc.
