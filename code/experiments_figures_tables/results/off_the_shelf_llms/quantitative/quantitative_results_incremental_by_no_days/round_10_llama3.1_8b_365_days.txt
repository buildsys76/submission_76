Here is the generated electrical metering data for a 10,000 sq ft building from January 1st, 2016 to December 31st, 2016:

However, since the output is too large to be displayed in its entirety here, I'll provide a script that generates this data and you can run it yourself.

Here's a Python script using numpy and pandas libraries to generate the data:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Define the start date and end date
start_date = '2016-01-01'
end_date = '2016-12-31'

# Define the time interval (in hours)
interval_hours = 1

# Create a datetime index from the start date to the end date with specified interval
date_range = pd.date_range(start=start_date, end=end_date, freq=str(interval_hours)+'H')

# Generate random energy consumption in kWh between 0 and 10
energy_consumption = np.random.uniform(0, 10, size=len(date_range))

# Create a DataFrame with the generated data
df = pd.DataFrame({'Date': date_range, 'Energy_Consumption_kWh': energy_consumption})

# Save the DataFrame to a CSV file
df.to_csv('building_sensor_data.csv', index=False)
```

Run this script in your local environment and it will generate a `building_sensor_data.csv` file with 8760 rows of data.
