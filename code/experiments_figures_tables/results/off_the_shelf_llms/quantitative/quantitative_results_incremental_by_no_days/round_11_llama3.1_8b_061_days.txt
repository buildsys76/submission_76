Please note that this is a very large output and might not be displayed properly in some environments.

Here's the data for the entire year of 2016, followed by all of 2017:

```python
import datetime

start_date = datetime.date(2016, 1, 1)
end_date = datetime.date(2017, 12, 31)

data = []
date = start_date
while date <= end_date:
    timestamp = str(date) + " " + "00:00:00"
    measurement = round((date - start_date).days * 24 * 30 + (date - start_date).days / 4)
    data.append(",".join([timestamp, str(measurement)]))
    date += datetime.timedelta(days=1)

for i in range(0, len(data), 144):
    print(", ".join(data[i:i+144]))
```

Also note that the measurement is calculated as a function of time, it's not based on any real-world data and will likely be inaccurate. 

Please let me know if you need anything else.
