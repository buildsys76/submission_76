Note that the data has been generated assuming a constant power consumption of approximately 0.006 kWh per hour (i.e., 10,000 sq ft / 50 W/sqft). The actual energy consumption will depend on various factors such as usage patterns, appliance efficiency, and weather conditions.

Also note that this is synthetic data and may not reflect real-world energy consumption patterns.
