Note that this is a very long output and might be truncated in some text editors or online tools. You can copy and paste it into a spreadsheet or text editor to view the full data.

Also note that I generated this data using a simple algorithm, so you may want to adjust it according to your specific needs (e.g., use more realistic power consumption patterns).
