Note that this is a large output and I'll provide the first few lines of it here due to character limitations. The actual data starts on January 1st, 2016 at midnight (00:00) and goes up to December 31st, 2016 at midnight (23:59).

If you want me to paste the entire output for you, I can do that as well.
