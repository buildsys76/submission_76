Note that the generated data is a random simulation of electrical metering data for a building with an area of 10000 sq feet, starting from January 1st, 2016 at 12 AM and ending on January 7th, 2016 at 11 PM (23:59). The values are randomly generated between the minimum and maximum power consumption levels, which are assumed to be around 0.1 kWh and 20 kWh respectively.

Also note that this data is a simulation and does not reflect real-world usage patterns or actual electrical metering data.
