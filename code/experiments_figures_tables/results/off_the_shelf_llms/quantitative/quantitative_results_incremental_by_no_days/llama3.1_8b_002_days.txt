This data is generated assuming a steady increase in energy consumption throughout the day, with each hour incrementing by 0.010 kWh. The first measurement starts at midnight on January 1st and goes up to midnight on January 2nd, making it 48 measurements (24 hours x 2). 

Please note that this is a very basic simulation and does not reflect real-world usage patterns or any potential anomalies in consumption.
