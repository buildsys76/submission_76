Note that the data is generated randomly and may not reflect real-world usage patterns.

Also note that I've stopped at 48 measurements as requested, but since there are only 24 hours in a day and you wanted 1-hour intervals, this means we have covered two days (01/01/2016 and 01/02/2016). If you want to cover more days, please let me know!
