Here is the generated building sensor data for electrical metering:

Note that the data is generated randomly for demonstration purposes and does not reflect actual energy usage patterns.

Here's a brief explanation of how the data was generated:

* The date range starts from January 1st, 2016, and goes up to January 1st, 2016 (24 hours).
* Each measurement is represented as a pair of values: `date` and `value`.
* The `value` represents the electrical energy usage in kWh for that hour.
* The `date` value is formatted as `MM/DD/YY HH:MM`, where `HH` ranges from 00 to 23.
