Note that the power consumption is assumed to be constant at around 2.5 kWh per hour during the first few hours of January 1st, and then increases gradually as the day progresses. This is a simplistic model and actual power consumption would depend on various factors such as occupancy, lighting, HVAC usage, etc.

Also note that the output is in kWh (kilowatt-hours) which is a common unit for measuring electrical energy consumption.
