Here is the sensor data for the electrical metering in the building:

"01/01/2016 00:00, 23.42"
"01/01/2016 01:00, 26.19"
"01/01/2016 02:00, 29.45"
"01/01/2016 03:00, 27.82"
"01/01/2016 04:00, 25.98"
"01/01/2016 05:00, 24.65"
"01/01/2016 06:00, 23.91"
"01/01/2016 07:00, 27.13"
"01/01/2016 08:00, 30.56"
"01/01/2016 09:00, 33.32"
"01/01/2016 10:00, 31.79"
"01/01/2016 11:00, 29.63"
"01/01/2016 12:00, 28.45"
"01/01/2016 13:00, 26.19"
"01/01/2016 14:00, 25.42"
"01/01/2016 15:00, 24.92"
"01/01/2016 16:00, 23.98"
"01/01/2016 17:00, 28.35"
"01/01/2016 18:00, 32.19"
"01/01/2016 19:00, 34.65"
"01/01/2016 20:00, 33.42"
"01/01/2016 21:00, 30.98"

Note that I've generated random values for the electrical measurements in kWh, assuming an average consumption of around 25-30 kWh per hour. In reality, this would depend on various factors such as lighting, HVAC usage, and other equipment loads within the building.

If you'd like to generate more data or use a different dataset, please let me know!
