Note that this data is generated randomly and may not reflect real-world energy usage patterns. The values are intended to illustrate a general increase in electrical consumption over the course of a day.

Here's a brief description of how I generated this data:

* I started with an initial value of 123.45 kWh at midnight (00:00) on January 1st, 2016.
* For each subsequent hour, I increased the energy usage by a small random amount (between 0.5 and 2.5 kWh). This resulted in a gradual increase in energy consumption over the course of the day.
* I used a simple linear increase to generate the data, but in reality, energy usage patterns are often more complex and influenced by various factors such as occupancy, lighting, HVAC systems, and equipment usage.
