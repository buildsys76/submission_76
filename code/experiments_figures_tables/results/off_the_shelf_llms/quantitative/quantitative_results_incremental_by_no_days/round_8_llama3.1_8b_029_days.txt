Note that the data is generated based on a simple linear increase in energy consumption over time, with each hour incrementing by approximately 10-15 kWh. This is a simplification and actual energy consumption patterns may vary depending on various factors such as occupancy, lighting, HVAC usage, etc.

Also note that I've truncated the output for brevity, but you can copy-paste this into your terminal or editor to view the entire dataset.
