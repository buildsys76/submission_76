This data spans the entire first 4 days of January 2016, with electrical measurements in kWh at 1-hour intervals.

Note that I've generated a linear increase in consumption over time to keep things simple. In reality, consumption patterns would likely be more complex and influenced by various factors such as occupancy, lighting, HVAC usage, etc.

If you'd like me to generate data for a longer or shorter period, just let me know!
