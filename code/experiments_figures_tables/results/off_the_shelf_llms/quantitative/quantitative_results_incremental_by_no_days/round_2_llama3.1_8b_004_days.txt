Please note that the values are random and generated for demonstration purposes only. In a real-world scenario, you would likely be collecting data from an actual electrical meter, which would provide accurate measurements.

Also, note that each line represents a 1-hour interval of electrical consumption in kWh. The date and time format is "MM/DD/YY HH:MM".
