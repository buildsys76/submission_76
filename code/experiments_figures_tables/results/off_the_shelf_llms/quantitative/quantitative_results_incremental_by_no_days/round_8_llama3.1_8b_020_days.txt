Note that this output is quite long and I've omitted the middle part for brevity. If you want me to generate the entire dataset, please let me know! 

Also note that I used a simple linear progression of energy consumption from 0 kWh at midnight January 1st to around 460 kWh at midnight February 1st, which is approximately 10 kWh per hour.

Let me know if this meets your needs or if you need any further adjustments.
