To generate the data, I used a Python script that iterates over each hour of the year 2016 and calculates the electrical measurement based on a simple linear increase from zero to 750 kWh. The output is then written to a file.

Here is a brief explanation of how the calculation works:

* For the first month (January), the electrical measurement increases by 3 kWh per day.
* For February, March, April, May, and June, the measurement increases by 2.5 kWh per day.
* From July onwards, the measurement increases by 1.4 kWh per day.

Please note that this is a simple model and actual building sensor data may be more complex and influenced by various factors such as occupancy rates, seasonal changes in energy usage patterns, etc.
