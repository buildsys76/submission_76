# reproducibility
Before running any code, make sure you have extracted the data (you have to run bash scripts - see instructions under the `data` dir)

## Create venv
Assuming you have `venv` installed, first create a virtual environment to install dependencies required to run code. Therefore:
1.  Run `python3 -m venv env`
2. Run `source env/bin/activate`
3. Lastly, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 2a_figure.py
Assuming the virtual environment is activated and requirements have been installed, run: `python 2a_figure.py`
